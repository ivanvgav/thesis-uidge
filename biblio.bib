  abstract = {Charles S. Peirce (1839–1914) is widely recognized as America’s greatest philosopher, the originator of pragmatism, and one of the founders of modern mathematical logic. He was also a pioneer in the field of "semiotics," the general theory of signs, and many have regarded him as the father of the contemporary form of the discipline. The volume is a specialized selection of unpublished writings spanning almost twenty years (1894–1913) that are essential to understand Peirce’s views about signs, their classification, and the relations between semiotics and logical inquiry. It comprises twenty-two selections, a historico-critical introduction, and an apparatus of editorial annotations. The selections are prepared following the methods of scholarly editing of philosophical texts. The book will be of interest to graduate students and researchers working in areas such as Peirce studies, the history of American philosophy and pragmatism, logic and history of logic, the history of analytic philosophy, philosophy of language, semiotics, and language sciences.},

  abstract = {There seem to be two distinct aspects to the role played by the Interpretant in Peirce’s account of the sign relation. On the one hand, the Interpretant is said to establish the relation between the Sign and Object. That is, the Sign can “stand for” its Object, and thereby actually function as a Sign, only by virtue of its being interpreted as such by an Interpretant. On the other hand, the Interpretant is said to be “determined” by the Sign in such a way that it is thereby mediately determined by the Sign’s Object. How can we understand the relation between these two aspects of the Interpretant? This is the question with which this paper is concerned. I begin by drawing a distinction between what I call the first-order function and second-order function of the Interpretant, and illustrating this distinction using Peirce’s example of comparing the letters p and b in §\hspace{0.25em}9 of the 1867 “On a New List of Categories.” I then show that this same distinction can be discerned in a significant passage in the second section of Peirce’s 1903 “A Syllabus of Certain Topics of Logic,” as well as in his early definition of the Interpretant in the “New List.” This double function of the Interpretant has been noted in the Peircean literature, specifically by Joseph Ransdell in his 1966 dissertation, and more recently by André De Tienne. However, an important aspect of what I call the second-order function of the Interpretant remains unclarified in Ransdell and De Tienne’s approaches, namely, its relation to the logical operation of hypostatic abstraction. I will show that the Interpretant, in its second-order function, plays a role formally identical in the sign process to the role played by hypostatic abstraction in Peirce’s demonstrations of the Reduction Thesis. This formal identity will afford us with a way of understanding the relation between the two aspects of the Interpretant in terms of hypostatic abstraction.},

The approach brackets the conscious experience of emotion, lists plausible features that emotions exhibit, and argues that alternative schemes (e.g., focusing on feelings or on neurobiology as the starting point) are unpromising candidates. We conclude with the benefits of our approach: one can study emotions in animals; one can look in the brain for the implementation of specific features; and one ends up with an architecture of the mind in which emotions are fully accommodated through their relations to the rest of cognition. Our article focuses on arguing for this general approach; as such, it is an essay in the philosophy of emotion rather than in the psychology or neuroscience of emotion.},

This paper argues that historical propriety concerning the analysis of borderline vagueness belongs to Peirce since he was the first to show that borderline vagueness is distinct from other forms of indeterminacy (e.g., generality, unspecificity, and uninformativeness) and that the application of vague predicates to borderline cases involves an intrinsic uncertainty.},

As certain pragmatists describe themselves as pluralists, the essay received its share of criticism; however, no response has succeeded in defeating the essay?s argument. Nonetheless, contemporary classical pragmatists persist in embracing the term. Something?s amiss. In this article, we defend a conclusion that differs importantly from that of the 2005 paper. We will show that pragmatism is consistent with a view that we call modest epistemological pluralism. Thus, pragmatists can be pluralists. However, contemporary classicalists should beware. Our argument shows that pragmatism and pluralism are consistent, not that they are intrinsically allied. More importantly, the modest epistemological pluralism is not the pluralism that contemporary classicalists seem most eager to embrace. The argument proceeds in six steps. First, we dispense with a common but unacceptable conception of pluralism. Second, we identify what pluralism must assert. Third, we distinguish different varieties of pluralism. Fourth, we argue that pragmatists must reject all pluralisms except for what we term modest epistemological pluralism. Fifth, we discuss the prospects for pragmatist-friendly modest epistemological pluralism. Finally, we address the concern that modest epistemological pluralism is not practically distinguishable from monism.},

  abstract = {En este artículo presento a Charles S. Peirce como un autor inmerso en los debates científicos de su época, cuya mirada integradora lo convierte en precursor de las actuales investigaciones sobre el comportamiento de sistemas auto-organizantes lejos del equilibrio y de una “síntesis evolutiva expandida” que no solo toma elementos de diversas ramas de la biología sino de la física. Esta capacidad de síntesis no debe sorprendernos si se examina la influencia del pensamiento evolutivo de Lamarck y Darwin, que junto con la mecánica estadística de Boltzmann y Maxwell ejercieron sobre la metafísica evolucionista Peirce. En este sentido presento la noción de “hábito” lamarckiano, como el factor mediador entre las perturbaciones provocadas por las circunstancias externas y las variaciones morfológicas heredables de los organismos, la cual por generalización contribuyó a la formulación de la categor ía de la terceridad, mientras que la triada darwiniana variación, herencia y selección fue entendida como una especificación de las categorías de primeridad, segundidad y terceridad. Por otra parte, Boltzmann influyó en la aceptación del azar ontológico (primeridad) y la idea de una flecha del tiempo irreversible y continuo, asociada a la terceridad. Discuto cómo, en oposición a la recurrencia cíclica en un universo ergódico propuesta por Poincaré, Peirce propuso ad hoc la “ley de la mente” para salvar la flecha del tiempo irreversible y creativo. En el contexto de la ciencia del siglo XIX, era correcto postular la “ley de la mente” para salvar la idea de evolución como argumento irrefutable y convincente en contra de la hegemónica visión mec ánica de la naturaleza que no podía explicar a) la determinaci ón de las condiciones iniciales, b) la emergencia de comportamientos orientados a metas específicas, y c) las bifurcaciones evolutivas generadas en elecciones impredecibles. La influencia de Maxwell en Peirce, se percibe en las explicaciones sobre los efectos anti-entrópicos ordenadores, las contingencias temporales, las bifurcaciones en momentos críticos y la argumentación contra la ergodicidad del universo. Para finalizar, presento una reflexión sobre la vigencia de las ideas peirceanas sobre la “evolución agapástica”, donde la “elección individual”, el hábito, la inteligencia promueven la cooperación, la reciprocidad, la asociación simbiótica y mutualista, contribuyendo así al incremento del potencial creativo de la naturaleza.},

This conception of the discipline has been challenged recently by the plurality of logics and in this book, Pavel Arazim extends the debate to offer a new view of logic as dynamic and without a definite, specific shape. The Problem of Plurality of Logics examines the origins of our standard view of logic alongside Kant's theories, the holistic view, the issue of logic's pragmatic significance and Robert Brandom's logical expressivism. Arazim then draws on proof-theoretical approaches to present a convincing argument for a dynamic version of logical inferentialism, which opens space for a new freedom to modify our own logic. He explores the scope, possibilities and limits of this freedom in order to highlight the future paths logic could take, as a motivation for further research. Marking a departure from logical monism and also from the recent doctrine of logical pluralism in its various forms, this book addresses current debates concerning the expressive role of logic and contributes to a lively area of discussion in analytic philosophy"--},

Nevertheless, there are some interesting issues concerning the set of metainferences validated by this logic. In this paper, we show that this logic, once it is adequately understood, is weaker than classical logic. Moreover, the logic is in a way similar to the paraconsistent logic LP.}

  abstract = {In this article, we will present a number of technical results concerning Classical Logic, ST and related systems. Our main contribution consists in offering a novel identity criterion for logics in general and, therefore, for Classical Logic. In particular, we will firstly generalize the ST phenomenon, thereby obtaining a recursively defined hierarchy of strict-tolerant systems. Secondly, we will prove that the logics in this hierarchy are progressively more classical, although not entirely classical. We will claim that a logic is to be identified with an infinite sequence of consequence relations holding between increasingly complex relata: formulae, inferences, metainferences, and so on. As a result, the present proposal allows not only to differentiate Classical Logic from ST, but also from other systems sharing with it their valid metainferences. Finally, we show how these results have interesting consequences for some topics in the philosophical logic literature, among them for the debate around Logical Pluralism. The reason being that the discussion concerning this topic is usually carried out employing a rivalry criterion for logics that will need to be modified in light of the present investigation, according to which two logics can be non-identical even if they share the same valid inferences.},

  abstract = {It is widely accepted that classical logic is trivialized in the presence of a transparent truth-predicate. In this paper, we will explain why this point of view must be given up. The hierarchy of metainferential logics defined in Barrio et al. (Journal of Philosophical Logic, 1–28, 2019) and Pailos (The Review of Symbolic Logic, Forthcoming) recovers classical logic, either in the sense that every classical (meta)inferential validity is valid at some point in the hierarchy (as is stressed in Barrio et al. (Journal of Philosophical Logic, 1–28, 2019)), or because a logic of a transfinite level defined in terms of the hierarchy shares its validities with classical logic. Each of these logics is consistent with transparent truth—as is shown in Pailos (The Review of Symbolic Logic, Forthcoming)—, and this suggests that, contrary to standard opinions, transparent truth is after all consistent with classical logic. However, Scambler (Journal of Philosophical Logic, 49, 351–370, 2020) presents a major challenge to this approach. He argues that this hierarchy cannot be identified with classical logic in any way, because it recovers no classical antivalidities. We embrace Scambler’s challenge and develop a new logic based on these hierarchies. This logic recovers both every classical validity and every classical antivalidity. Moreover, we will follow the same strategy and show that contingencies need also be taken into account, and that none of the logics so far presented is enough to capture classical contingencies. Then, we will develop a multi-standard approach to elaborate a new logic that captures not only every classical validity, but also every classical antivalidity and contingency. As a€truth-predicate can be added to this logic, this result can be interpreted as showing that, despite the claims that are extremely widely accepted, classical logic does not trivialize in the context of transparent truth.},

We examine Peirce’s proposal that the relation of illation is the primitive relation of logic and defend the view that this idea constitutes the fundamental motive of philosophy of notation both in algebraic and graphical logic. We explain how in his algebras and graphs Peirce arrived at a unifying notation for logical constants that represent both truth-function and scope.

Peirce at the end of the~19th century, and the ordinary notation of first-order logic. Peirce thought his graphs to be “more diagrammatic” than equivalently expressive languages (including his own algebras) for quantificational logic. The reason of this, he claimed, is that less room is afforded in Existential Graphs than in equivalently expressive languages for different ways of representing the same fact. The reason of this, in turn, is that Existential Graphs are a               non-linear               ,               occurrence-referential               notation. As a non-linear notation, each graph corresponds to a class of logically equivalent but syntactically distinct sentences of the ordinary notation of first-order logic that are obtained by permuting those elements (sentential variables, predicate expressions, and quantifiers) that in the graphs lie in the same area. As an occurrence-referential notation, each Beta graph corresponds to a class of logically equivalent but syntactically distinct sentences of the ordinary notation of first-order logic in which the identity of reference of two or more variables is asserted. In brief, Peirce’s graphs are more diagrammatic than the linear, type-referential notation of first-order logic because the function that translates the latter to the graphs does not define isomorphism between the two notations.},

The argument moves from an imaginary, subtextual dialogue between several authors in the history of logic and the philosophy of language (Aristotle, Ammonius, Boethius, Frege, Peirce, Geach, and Dummett) and shows that the problem of the relationship between conjunction and assertion is quite old and has received distinct and irreconcilable treatments. Peirce has an original take on the problem, which he addresses, as often happens in his mature writings, in notational terms: the anomaly of conjunction (i.e., the fact that, unlike the other connectives, conjunction is subject to assertion distribution) is not to be hidden behind a uniform notation, like standard sentential calculus, in which the conjunction connective is treated on a par with the other connectives. Rather, a sentential language is possible that embodies rather than conceals the anomaly, and this is Peirce's system of Existential Graphs, which from 1896 onwards understandably becomes his preferred instrument of logical analysis.}

This article outlines a new interpretation of what prompted this unexpected elevation of the third subdivision of semiotic (understood as logic in the broad sense), and explores some of the implications of the proposed reading. Two plausible explanations are identified, leading to an exposition of Peirce’s equally puzzling association of rhetoric with objective logic in the 1890s. The final part of the essay briefly addresses the question of how Peirce’s subsequent shift from rhetoric to methodeutic may have affected his conception of the concluding branch of logic.},

  abstract = {Peirce’s semiotics is a formal doctrine of signs. As such, semiotics “would be concerned, in part, to determine the conditions for counting anything as true” (Liszka 1996: 2). Sometimes, semiotics is reduced to its first branch, speculative grammar, which concerns the classification of signs. However, critic and methodeutic are fundamental to guarantee the accuracy of the semiotic process. Critic gives “the conditions which determine the reasoning to be secure” (c.1902, CP 2.1) and methodeutic is the “study of the necessary conditions of the transmission of meaning by signs from mind to mind” (c.1897, CP 1.444). When we observe the system of sixty-six sign classes, we can find a method that provides confidence in the reasoning process. That means we can find classes of signs that represent critic and methodeutic in this system. The set of symbolic signs are the core of this process. In this paper, I will examine the interpretants of symbolic signs in order to describe the production of interpretants that increase the level of confidence in reasoning, contributing to the evolution of thought. The system of sixty-six sign classes provides a more complex set of interpretants, which might show the relation between the three branches of semiotics.},

  abstract = {Abstract C.S. Peirce held what is nowadays called a “commitment view” of assertion. According to this type of view, assertion is a kind of act that is determined by its “normative effects”: by asserting a proposition one undertakes certain commitments, typically to be able to provide reason to believe what one is asserting, or, in Peirce's words, one “takes responsibility” for the truth of the proposition one asserts. Despite the fact that Peirce was an early proponent of the view, if his commitment view of assertion is mentioned at all in contemporary discussions it is only in passing. His view is, however, far more complex and nuanced than he has been given credit for. My primary goal here, then, is to get a better understanding of Peirce's version of a commitment view of assertion. I then argue that figuring out the details of Peirce's theory of assertion can provide us with a viable way to respond to certain problems faced by contemporary commitment views of assertion.},

Doing so will help make better sense of Peirce’s pragmatism; further, what is hidden amongst various fragments is a robust pragmatist theory of assertion with unique characteristics that may have significant contemporary value. Here we aim to uncover this theory, and to show that assertion for Peirce is not a mere corollary of pragmatic conceptions of truth, judgement, and belief, but is rather a central aspect of his philosophy.},

According to this challenge, there are basic logical principles, and part of what makes such principles basic is that they are epistemically exceptional. Thus, according to this challenge, the existence of basic logical principles provides reason to reject anti-exceptionalism about logic. I argue that this challenge fails, and that the exceptionalist positions motivated by it are thus unfounded. I make this case by disambiguating two senses of ‘basic’ and showing that, once this disambiguation is taken into account, the best reason we have for thinking that there are basic principles actually implies that those principles do not require a special epistemology. Consequently, the existence of basic logical principles provides reason to accept, rather than reject, anti-exceptionalism concerning the epistemology of logic. I conclude by explaining how an abductivist, anti-exceptionalist approach to the epistemology of logic can accommodate the notion of basic logical principles.},

Having offered a primer on semiotics, I now want to use some of those helpful resources. Ned Block distinguishes access-consciousness and phenomenal-consciousness. Convinced that his distinction is a real one, Block posits a module in the brain responsible for phenomenal experiences. However, I argue that we can make better sense of Block’s distinction if we regard it as a prescissive one. In order to clarify this stance, I examine experiments conducted by George Sperling. Sperling designed tasks that let test subjects access visual experiences that they previously could not act upon. Block thinks that Sperling’s results vindicate his claims, but strictly speaking Sperling’s experiments tracked only access-consciousness. I thus conclude that, to establish that phenomenal experiences were present prior to being accessed, we must prescissively suppose the subjects’ tasks absent.},

However, I argue that, because bivalence is a principle, the strategy used by Peirce to defend logical principles can be used to defend bivalence. Construing logic as the study of substitutions of equivalent representations, Peirce showed that some patterns of substitution get realized in the very act of questioning them. While I recognize that we can devise non-classical notations, I argue that, when we make claims about those notations, we inevitably get saddled with bivalent commitments. I present several simple inferences to show this. The argument that results from those examples is ‘pragmatic’, because the inevitability of the principle is revealed in use (not mention); and it is ‘semiotic’, because this revelation happens in the use of signs.},

In this paper, we develop a formal framework in which the claim can be stated and examined, and certain puzzles resolved. We start by asking how physical things can represent information in some target domain. We lay a basis for investigating possible homomorphisms by modeling both the physical medium and the target domain as sets of variables, each with a constraint structure. When a homomorphism exists, the causality of the physical medium can provide a “free ride,” automatically determining the information that is needed to solve a problem. The modeling technique enables us to show how in sentential representations the structure of the 2-D space is used non-homomorphically to define tokens, and to provide a minimal homomorphism with respect to the ordering of the arguments for n-ary functions, predicates, and operators, but otherwise there is no homomorphism with the target domain. Our treatment also characterizes diagrams as a type of a more general class of physical representations in which physical causality plays a role in providing the information needed to solve a problem.},

Those definitions include so-called pure consequence, order-theoretic consequence and mixed consequence. In this article, we examine whether those definitions together carve out a natural class of consequence relations. We respond positively by identifying a small set of properties that we see instantiated in those various consequence relations, namely truth-relationality, value-monotonicity, validity-coherence and a constraint of bivalence-compliance, provably replaceable by a structural requisite of nontriviality. Our main result is that the class of consequence relations satisfying those properties coincides exactly with the class of mixed consequence relations and their intersections, including pure consequence relations and order-theoretic consequence. We provide an enumeration of the set of those relations in finite many-valued logics of two extreme kinds: those in which truth values are well-ordered and those in which values between 0 and 1 are incomparable.},

For instance, does there always exist a conditional operator internalizing the consequence relation, and which form should it take? In this paper, we pose this question in a multi-premise multiconclusion setting for the class of so-called intersective mixed consequence relations, which extends the class of Tarskian relations. Using computer-aided methods, we answer extensively for 3-valued and 4-valued logics, focusing not only on conditional operators, but also on what we call Gentzen-regular connectives (including negation, conjunction, and disjunction). For arbitrary N-valued logics, we state necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of such connectives in a multi-premise multi-conclusion setting. The results show that mixed consequence relations admit all classical connectives, and among them pure consequence relations are those that admit no other Gentzen-regular connectives. Conditionals can also be found for a broader class of intersective mixed consequence relations, but with the exclusion of order-theoretic consequence relations.},

  abstract = {Suszko's problem is the problem of finding the minimal number of truth values needed to semantically characterize a syntactic consequence relation. Suszko proved that every Tarskian consequence relation can be characterized using only two truth values. Malinowski showed that this number can equal three if some of Tarski's structural constraints are relaxed. By so doing, Malinowski introduced a case of so-called mixed consequence, allowing the notion of a designated value to vary between the premises and the conclusions of an argument. In this paper we give a more systematic perspective on Suszko's problem and on mixed consequence. First, we prove general representation theorems relating structural properties of a consequence relation to their semantic interpretation, uncovering the semantic counterpart of substitution-invariance, and establishing that (intersective) mixed consequence is fundamentally the semantic counterpart of the structural property of monotonicity. We use those to derive maximum-rank results proved recently in a different setting by French and Ripley, as well as by Blasio, Marcos and Wansing, for logics with various structural properties (reflexivity, transitivity, none, or both). We strengthen these results into exact rank results for non-permeable logics (roughly, those which distinguish the role of premises and conclusions). We discuss the underlying notion of rank, and the associated reduction proposed independently by Scott and Suszko. As emphasized by Suszko, that reduction fails to preserve compositionality in general, meaning that the resulting semantics is no longer truth-functional. We propose a modification of that notion of reduction, allowing us to prove that over compact logics with what we call regular connectives, rank results are maintained even if we request the preservation of truth-functionality and additional semantic properties.},

Among other definitions, an analytic proposition is said to be a proposition whose predicate is “covertly contained” in its subject. C.S. Peirce repeatedly examined this distinction with critical interest, and recognized both the usefulness and the limitations of classifying all propositions into these two types. Long before Quine’s attacks on this so-called dogma, he suggested the need to strongly relativize the dichotomy. The article is an attempt to list Peirce’s major arguments against considering all propositions as either analytic or synthetic and against the general relevance of the dichotomy. Without pre- tensions of being exhaustive, the main arguments are: the fact that non-ampliative judgments may also produce an increase in knowledge; that the logic of relatives proves the distinction to be irrelevant; that the Existential Graphs also reshape the line between the analytic and the synthetic; that a proposition may be indifferently analytic or synthetic depending on what universe of discourse it refers to; that analytic truths are no more necessary than synthetic truths; and that the purely given on which synthetic propositions are based is a myth.},

It argues that attending to this intersection is critical for a fuller understanding of how affective and emotional dynamics can assist to entrench, but also disrupt, asymmetries of epistemic privilege that cut across lines of race, sex, and other markers of social difference. As part of this discussion the paper reflects on the possibility of intervening in dominant social imaginaries that become sedimented in the routine operations of the modern university, and which produce affective ecologies that sustain epistemic exclusions within academic institutions.},

  abstract = {[Editor’s Note: The following new entry by Nicolas Clerboutand Zoe McConaughey replaces the former entry on this topic by the previous author.], Dialogical logic is a dialogue-based approach to logic andargumentation rooted in a research tradition that goes back todialectics in Greek Antiquity, when problems were approached throughdialogues in which opposing parties discussed a thesis throughquestions and answers. The dialogical framework was first worked outin its modern form by Paul Lorenzen and Kuno Lorenz in the context ofconstructive mathematics and logic, and inspired many“dialogical logics” that follow more or less the initialprogram, thus creating what can be called traditions in dialogicallogic. This entry focuses on the developments of dialogical logic inthe Lorenzen and Lorenz tradition, which developed in the 1990s and2000s into a fruitful framework for the study, comparison, andcombination of various non-classical systems, giving rise to what hasbeen called dialogical pluralism. References to the othertraditions will nonetheless be provided., In the Lorenzen and Lorenz tradition, dialogical logic uses conceptsof both game and argumentation theory to provide a pragmatist approachto meaning and reasoning constituted during the interaction of twoplayers arguing on a given thesis. The game rules allow these playersto challenge the other’s statements or defend their ownstatements in such a way that one player wins and the other losesafter a finite number of moves. The meaning of the logical constantsis provided by a set of interaction rules (the local rules) and thedialogical equivalent of a demonstration is a construction of playsthrough which it is shown that one player may win whatever the otherplayer’s moves may be (winning strategy). Thus, both thedialogical meaning of the logical constants and the dialogicalconception of demonstration are constituted by interaction.}

The semantics, which makes use of indifference relations to model similarity, rests on the interaction of three notions of truth: the classical notion, and two dual notions simultaneously defined in terms of it, which we call tolerant truth and strict truth. We characterize the space of consequence relations definable in terms of those and discuss the kind of solution this gives to the sorites paradox. We discuss some applications of the framework to the pragmatics and psycholinguistics of vague predicates, in particular regarding judgments about borderline cases.},

Most philosophers in the literature fall into one camp or the other: philosophical skepticism or philosophical anti-skepticism. Drawing on the insights of hinge epistemology, this paper proposes another way forward, an intermediate position that appeals both to skeptical and anti-skeptical intuitions concerning the possibility and scope of philosophical knowledge.

Whether we consider his definition of reality as the external permanence which gives science its selfcorrective, or his definition of reality as the object of the final opinion in the long run, Peirce clearly intends to connect his idea of reality to the practice of inquiry. In this paper, we will consider some of the difficulties of applying the same pragmatic argument when it comes to the reality of mathematics. First, there is the difficulty of discerning what Peirce's position is regarding the reality of mathematics, since there are several disparities in his writings. Second, there is the difficulty of which view regarding the reality of mathematics serves inquiry best. In other words, must a mathematician suppose he studies real entities in order to practice mathematics? In considering this problem, we will examine the Quine-Putnam Indispensability thesis, as well as Angus Kerr-Lawson's bicategorial view. We will conclude that Peirce's philosophy of mathematics only apparently commits him to a bicategorial ontological dualism, and that is more monistic view-which is more agreeable to the Indispensability Thesis-is ultimately preferable.},

While Peirce writes extensively on the pragmatic meaning of a "would be", he does not provide a developed account of the pragmatic meaning of a mathematical "must be". After examining several possibilities such as information relative accounts, conceivability, the ideal world, and possible worlds accounts, we consider mathematical necessity in terms of his overall pragmatism whereby metaphysical notions are understood in terms of their pragmatic effects, and, in particular, their role in inquiry. We argue that mathematical necessity should be considered a regulative hypothesis. Peirce often addresses questions of modality, such as whether to posit real possibility or physical necessity, by appealing to what is good for inquiry. Just as the hypothesis of the real world constrains and directs inquiry in science, positing the reality of mathematical possibility (or what Peirce sometimes calls " substantive possibility") can also be seen to constrain and direct mathematical inquiry as well as natural science. The necessity of mathematics may, in the end, be stipulated in the form of a hypothesis, just as the reality of the natural world functions as a hypothesis in Peirce's system. The effect of positing this ideal world of substantive possibility lies both in its effects within mathematical inquiry, and ultimately within the natural sciences as mathematical conclusions constrain the hypotheses we see fit to entertain.},

I argue that there is a relation of co-determination between the operational and structural aspects of a logic. As a result, some features of the consequence relation are induced by the connectives. I propose that a connective is defined by those rules which are conservative and unique, while at the same time expressing only connective-induced structural information. This is the key to stabilizing the meaning of the connectives across multiple determinations of the consequence relation.},

It aims at explaining the meaning of the logical constants in terms of the inference rules that govern their behaviour in proofs. We argue that this must be construed as the task of explaining these meanings relative to a logic, i.e., to a consequence relation. Alas, there is no agreed set of properties that a relation must have in order to qualify as a consequence relation. Moreover, the association of a consequence relation to a logical calculus is not as straightforward as it may seem. We show that these facts are problematic for the proof-theoretic project but the problems can be solved. Our thesis is that the consequence relation relevant for proof-theoretic semantics is the one given by the sequent-to-sequent derivability relation in Gentzen systems.},

And (3) the classical rules for negation do not conserve evidence. So (4) realism is wrong. Most realists reject 2. But it has recently been argued that if we allow denied sentences as premisses and conclusions in inferences we will be able to reject 3. And this new argument against 3 generates a new response to the anti-realist argument: keep 1 and 2, avoiding 4 by rejecting 3. My aim in this paper is to see how much work in the fight against anti-realism this new response can really do. I argue that there is a powerful objection to the response: 2 is in tension with the claim that denied sentences can be premisses and conclusions in inferences. But I show that, even given this objection, the new response has an important role to play.},

The function is to support the coordination of our belief-forming rules, which in turn supports the reliable acquisition of beliefs through testimony. This view is motivated by the existence of valid inferences that we hesitate to call rational. I defend the view against the worry that it fails to account for a function of evaluations within first-personal deliberation. In the rest of the paper, I then argue, on the basis of epistemic communism, for a view about rationality itself. I set up the argument in section 2 by saying what a theory of rational deduction is supposed to do. I claim that such a theory would provide a necessary, sufficient, and explanatorily unifying condition for being a rational rule for inferring deductive consequences. I argue in section 3 that, given epistemic communism and the conventionality that it entails, there is no such theory. Nothing explains why certain rules for deductive reasoning are rational.},

This family includes systems analogous to the Lambek calculus of syntactic categories, systems of relevant logic, systems related toBCK algebras, and, finally, Johansson's and Heyting's logic. First, sequent-systems are given for these logics, and cut-elimination results are proved. In these sequent-systems the rules for the logical operations are never changed: all changes are made in the structural rules. Next, Hubert-style formulations are given for these logics, and algebraic completeness results are demonstrated with respect to residuated lattice-ordered groupoids. Finally, model structures related to relevant model structures (of Urquhart, Fine, Routley, Meyer, and Maksimova) are given for our logics. These model structures are based on groupoids parallel to the sequent-systems. This paper lays the ground for a kind of correspondence theory for axioms of logics with implication weaker than Heyting's, a correspondence theory analogous to the correspondence theory for modal axioms of normal modal logics.},

Its main point is that many of the currently pervasive views on form and matter with respect to logic rest on several substantive and even contentious assumptions which are nevertheless uncritically accepted. Indeed, many of the issues raised by the application of this distinction to arguments seem to be related to a questionable combination of different presuppositions and expectations; this holds in particular of the vexed issue of demarcating the class of logical constants. I begin with a characterization of currently widespread views on form and matter in logic, which I refer to as `logical hylomorphism as we know it'—LHAWKI, for short —and argue that the hylomorphism underlying LHAWKI is mereological. Next, I sketch an overview of the historical developments leading from Aristotelian, non-mereological metaphysical hylomorphism to mereological logical hylomorphism ( LHAWKI). I conclude with a reassessment of the prospects for the combination of hylomorphism and logic, arguing in particular that LHAWKI is not the only and certainly not the most suitable version of logical hylomorphism. In particular, this implies that the project of demarcating the class of logical constants as a means to define the scope and nature of logic rests on highly problematic assumptions.},

The claim is that, rather than mono-agent mental processes, (deductive) logic in fact comprises norms for quite specific situations of multi-agent dialogical interactions, in particular special forms of debates. This reconceptualization is inspired by historical developments in logic and mathematics (briefly surveyed in the paper), in particular the pervasiveness of such dialogical conceptions in the early days of logic in ancient Greece. The multi-agent, dialogical perspective then allows for the formulation of compelling ’bridge principles’ between the relation of logical consequence and dialogical normative principles, something that is notoriously difficult to achieve in a mono-agent setting pertaining exclusively to thought and belief. The upshot is also that the truth-preserving rules of logic generally do not have a primary normative bearing on mono-agent mental processes, and in this sense the paper sides with Harman’s (1986; 2009) critique of the idea that logic has a normative import for thought and belief.},

Moreover, in the mathematics education literature number of studies have shown that students find it difficult to truly comprehend the idea of reductio proofs, which indicates the cognitive complexity of these constructions. In this paper, I start by discussing four philosophical issues pertaining to reductio arguments. I then briefly present a dialogical conceptualization of deductive arguments, according to which such arguments (especially mathematical proofs) are best understood as a dialogue between two (fictitious) participants—Prover and Skeptic. Finally, I argue that many of the philosophical and cognitive difficulties surrounding reductio arguments are dispelled or at least further clarified once one adopts a dialogical perspective.},

But whatever restrictions on structural rules we may want to enforce, it is highly desirable that such restrictions be accompanied by independent philosophical motivation, not directly related to paradoxes. Indeed, while these recent developments have shed new light on a number of issues pertaining to paradoxes, it seems that we now have even more open questions than before, in particular two very pressing ones: what (independent) motivations do we have (if any) for restrictions on structural rules, and what to make of the plurality of new logics emerging from these restrictions, i.e. how to ‘choose’ among the different options. In this paper, we address these two questions from the perspective of a dialogical conception of logic that we've been advocating in recent years. We will argue that dialogical interpretations of structural rules, that is, as rules determining specific properties of the dialogues in question, provide a conveniently neutral framework to adjudicate between the different substructural proposals that have been made in the literature on paradoxes.},

This is to be achieved by describing what legal agents do while appealing to different propositions of fact and inferring from them throughout the course of legal proceedings. The authors claim that the process of applying the law is ultimately rooted in the inferential discursive practices of exchanging reasons on the part of the participants of legal proceedings. Therefore, they set forth a model of legal proceedings that consists of an interplay between three types of reasons, which are exchanged by the participants of legal proceedings: i.e. legal reasons, epistemic reasons and stake reasons. To illustrate this interplay, the authors deploy a metaphor of law as a game, and provide a description of legal proceedings as a particular instance of playing a game of law. The conclusion is that the legal concept of evidence is (at least in part) constituted by the role that evidence plays in affecting which reasons for action the participants to legal proceedings choose to act on. The other final assumption of this paper is metatheoretical: authors want to show that when analyzing what legal evidence is, one should begin from the perspective of a singular instance of legal proceedings, rather than from the perspective of law in general.},

  abstract = {Michael Eldridge Why a Pragmatist May Be a Pluralist Being a pluralist is understood to be so much a part of being a pragmatist that Robert Talisse's challenge is met with incredulity by most pragmatists. Prominent members of the (2003) Society for the Advancement of American Philosophy scowled at the mention of Scott Aikin and Talisse's paper, "Why Pragmatists Cannot Be Pluralists," or uttered brief dismissive comments, as if it was beyond discussion. I suppose this is because many aligned themselves over the past several decades with others out of the philosophical mainstream, forming a "pluralist" alliance to challenge what was perceived as the analytic majority within the American Philosophical Association. Or, on a more intellectual level, we have taken our experimentalist, fallibilist, antiessentialist and antifoundationalist position to imply that one should always be cautious in one's affirmations. Seldom do we expect to find commonality on significant matters in a diverse world. Our pervasive democratic beliefs and practices re-enforce this tentativeness and encourage us to be tolerant. Finally, most philosophers are sufficiently skeptical and of an independent cast of mind that we expect to encounter intellectual disagreement within our profession. One is a pragmatist, in large part, because one lacks both Truth and Certainty and has come to value diversity. To be a pragmatist is to be pluralistic. Talisse is well aware of these deeply held beliefs and attitudes and has fashioned his argument to account for them. He has no problem with political pluralism, intellectual (and other kinds of) diversity, experimentalist attitudes and practices, and the philosopher's characteristic iconoclasm. He has often championed engagement with those with whom he disagrees, argued for an inquiry-based politics, and been more than willing to smash a few icons, not least of which is the pragmatist-as-pluralist one. So what is the pluralism that he finds objectionable? He has been very clear that what he is targeting is a view that is prominent in discussions of contemporary democratic theory that holds that "some, and perhaps many, ... disagreements are inevitable, irresolvable, non-contingent, and, in a word, permanent" ("Can Democracy be a Way of Life?" TCSPS 39.3). Nor has he been unclear about why a pragmatist cannot hold this view: Pragmatists are committed to the view of the resolvability of our disagreements through appropriately Transactions of the Charles S. Peirce Society Winter, 2005, Vol. XLI, No. 1 120 Michael Eldridge performed inquiry. But, as Talisse points out, this confidence in social intelligence is contested by some (39.11). There is no agreement among those participating in the discussions of contemporary democratic theory that a Peircean or Deweyan model of inquiry is either necessary or sufficient. Thus the pluralisms irresolvable differences have moved from substance to procedure. Deep pluralism remains and the pragmatist is committed to a method of resolving differences that threaten our common well being. Hence pluralism and pragmatism are incompatible. Talisse is a skilful and resourceful polemicist, and he is certainly knowledgeable about pragmatism and democratic theory. Yet I think his argument is problematic. I do not know if society over the long run is ultimately pluralistic in the strong sense. It may be that important differences will always be with us. But that does not necessarily mean that there will always be permanent conflicts about the same values and practices. If this is what pluralism entails, then, yes, Talisse is right Â— a pragmatist must not be a pluralist. And Talisse may well be right that this is the sense in which pluralism is understood in contemporary discussions of democratic theory. If so, then the pragmatist has a problem entering into this discussion as it is currently framed, for, meliorist that she is, she is committed to the notion of occasional resolution of differences Â— even those that now appear to be irreconcilable. The strong pluralist, as Talisse describes the position, is making a claim about a reality that is not now accessible to us. Thus it smacks of certainty and the a priori and other notions of which the pragmatist is wary. What we do know, and here I am making an empirical assertion, is that sometimes deep intellectual, social and political disagreements are...},

  abstract = {Lorenzen has introduced his dialogical approach to the foundations of logic in the late 1950s to justify intuitionistic logic with respect to first principles about constructive reasoning. In the decades that have passed since, Lorenzen-style dialogue games turned out to be an inspiration for a more pluralistic approach to logical reasoning that covers a wide array of nonclassical logics. In particular, the close connection between (single-sided) sequent calculi and dialogue games is an invitation to look at substructural logics from a dialogical point of view. Focusing on intuitionistic linear logic, we illustrate that intuitions about resource-conscious reasoning are well served by translating sequent calculi into Lorenzen-style dialogue games. We suggest that these dialogue games may be understood as games of information extraction, where a sequent corresponds to the claim that a certain information package can be systematically extracted from a given bundle of such packages of logically structured information. As we will indicate, this opens the field for exploring new logical connectives arising by consideration of further forms of storing and structuring information.},

We will concentrate on the apprehension of the movement of reasoning, which diagrammatically begins with speculative grammar, runs through critical logic, and consolidates at methodeutics. We seek to apply the trichotomic logic of Peirce to list the modes of reasoning with diagrams. Our intention is to move away from the categorization as taxonomy, and try to understand how sign classes can be used in the inferential process. Thus, considering a possible relationship between the hypoicon, the three classes of iconic signs in the system of ten classes of signs, and the methods of inference, we suggest three subclasses of diagrams in inferential terms that may offer a grading system, which would present degrees of accuracy or probative capacity.},

On the other hand, anti-exceptionalism rejects those particular traits. Recently, it has been suggested that the Adoption Problem of logical rules traverses the discussion between both positions. In this paper, I argue that that is not the case. In particular, I hold that if the Adoption Problem is a crucial threat to logic as a discipline, anti-exceptionalism about logic must be an incorrect position. Otherwise, exceptionalism about logic must be incorrect. In addition, I assess some consequences that follow from the previous analysis concerning the discussion on monism and pluralism about logic.},

First, I provide sequent rules and axioms for all the logics in the hierarchy, for all inferential levels, and establish soundness and completeness results. Second, I show how to extend those systems with a corresponding hierarchy of validity predicates, each one of which is meant to capture “validity” at a different inferential level. Then, I point out two potential philosophical implications of these results. (i) Since the logics in the hierarchy differ from one another on the rules, I argue that each such logic maintains its own distinct identity (contrary to arguments like the one given by Dicher and Paoli in 2019). (ii) Each validity predicate need not capture “validity” at more than one metainferential level. Hence, there are reasons to deny the thesis (put forward in Barrio, E., Rosenblatt, L. \& Tajer, D. (Synthese, 2016)) that the validity predicate introduced in by Beall and Murzi in (Journal o f Philosophy, 110(3), 143–165, 2013) has to express facts not only about what follows from what, but also about the metarules, etc.},

Two versions of this neutrality can be found in the literature: an agreed upon collection of inferences, and a metalanguage that is neutral as such. I discuss both versions and show that they are not immune to Quinean criticism, which builds on the notion of meaning. In particular, I show that (i) the first version of neutrality is sub-optimal, and hard to reconcile with the theories of meaning for logical constants, and (ii) the second version collapses mathematically, if rival logics, as object languages, are treated with charity in the metalanguage. I substantiate (ii) by proving a collapse theorem that generalizes familiar results. Thus, the existence of a neutral metalanguage cannot be taken for granted, and meaning-invariant logical pluralism might turn out to be dubious.},

A similar attitude, he claims, is prevalent in ethics, which approaches the subject from the perspective of the study of moral mistakes. He uses a distinction between definitory and strategic rules to examine this shortcoming and its consequences in logic. Hintikka does not examine the other side of his analogy, namely the distinction in theories of ethics, however. In this paper we examine those ethics-related aspects of his analogy that have previously gone unnoticed. They are: (1) the possibility of introducing and applying a novel distinction to ethics to distinguish two fundamentally different kinds of ethical rules, the definitory and the strategic rules; (2) the use of these rules to illustrate a fundamental shortcoming in the modern conception of normative ethics; (3) the possibility to separate two conceptions of ethics from each other based on the type of rules that they aim to formulate; (4) the radically different yet unexplored idea of treating ethical rules as strategic rules; and (5) taking Peirce’s habits as strategic rules of interaction at work in both ethical and logical conduct.},

  abstract = {Mathematical proofs are not sequences of arbitrary deductive steps—each deductive step is, to some extent, rational. This paper aims to identify and characterize the particular form of rationality at play in mathematical proofs. The approach adopted consists in viewing mathematical proofs as reports of proof activities—that is, sequences of deductive inferences—and in characterizing the rationality of the former in terms of that of the latter. It is argued that proof activities are governed by specific norms of rational planning agency, and that a deductive step in a mathematical proof qualifies as rational whenever the corresponding deductive inference in the associated proof activity figures in a plan that has been constructed rationally. It is then shown that mathematical proofs whose associated proof activities violate these norms are likely to be judged as defective by mathematical agents, thereby providing evidence that these norms are indeed present in mathematical practice. We conclude that, if mathematical proofs are not mere sequences of deductive steps, if they possess a rational structure, it is because they are the product of rational planning agents.}

  abstract = {One of the greatest disasters that befell twentieth-century analytic philosophy was Quine's (1953) rejection of the distinction between analytic and synthetic truths as an “untenable dualism”, to use Morton White's (1950) phrase. Or rather, the disaster was the widespread acceptance of this untenable rejection. It deprived philosophers of the means of mastering the defining concept of our era, the notion of information. It made it apparently pointless for them to use axiomatization or other kind of logical systematization as a tool of serious philosophical analysis, and hence encouraged the currently popular no-brainer appeals to “intuitions”. (cf. Hintikka 1999) These unfortunate consequences follow because on Quine's view a deduction of a theorem from axioms (and more generally a deduction of a consequence from premises) can introduce what for us is new factual information, for according to Quine such information cannot be separated from what for us is purely linguistic information. Hence the cognitive content (factual information) of a theory cannot be summed up in its axioms, for new assumptions can be introduced by the logical and mathematical methods used in the derivation of the theorems. This was precisely the kind of conundrum that the great David Hilbert sought to eliminate by means of his axiomatic approach, as shown by the sixth problem in his famous list of open problems.

This logic does not e.g. allow the definition and study of mathematicians’ uniformity concepts important in analysis. Mathematicians’ stronger logic was rediscovered around 1990 as the form of independence-friendly logic which hence is not a new logic nor a further development of ordinary first-order logic but a richer version of it.},

Instead, logical theories are continuous with scientific theories, and knowledge about logic is as hard-earned as knowledge of physics, economics, and chemistry. Once we reject apriorism about logic, however, we need an alternative account of how logical theories are justified and revised. A number of authors have recently argued that logical theories are justified by abductive argument (e.g. Gillian Russell, Graham Priest, Timothy Williamson). This paper explores one crucial question about the abductive strategy: what counts as evidence for a logical theory? I develop three accounts of evidential confirmation that an anti-exceptionalist can accept: (1) intuitions about validity, (2) the Quine-Williamson account, and (3) indispensability arguments. I argue, against the received view, that none of the evidential sources support classical logic.},

Schurz's (2008) distinction of eleven “patterns of abduction” that he organizes in four groups, I suggest an even more comprehensive classification that distinguishes 15 forms in an alternative structure. These forms are organized, on the one hand, with regard to what is abductively inferred—singular facts, types, laws, theoretical models, or representation systems—and, on the other, with regard to the question whether the abductive procedure is selective or creative (including a distinction between “psychologically creative,” as in school learning, or “historically creative”). Moreover, I argue that theoretical-model abduction—which seems to be the most important form of abduction—depends on two preconditions: first on the availability of an adequate system of representation, and second on finding a new “perspective” on a given problem, as Peirce described it with the notion of a “theoric transformation.” To understand the significance of theoric transformations—especially in mathematics—it is necessary to analyze in some detail Peirce's main example for a theoric transformation: the proof of Desargues's theorem.},

The main function of Peirce's form of diagrammatic reasoning is to facilitate individual or social thinking processes in situations that are too complex to be coped with exclusively by internal cognitive means. I provide a diagrammatic definition of diagrammatic reasoning that emphasizes the construction of, and experimentation with, external representations based on the rules and conventions of a chosen representation system. The second part starts with a summary of empirical research regarding cognitive effects of working with diagrams and a critique of approaches that use “mental models” to explain those effects. The main focus of this section is, however, to elaborate the idea that diagrammatic reasoning should be conceptualized as a case of “distributed cognition.” Using the mathematics lesson described by Plato in his Meno, I analyze those cognitive conditions of diagrammatic reasoning that are relevant in this case.},

  abstract = {It is commonplace to describe the pragmatist conception of truth (PT) as incompatible with correspondence theory. This popular description relies on a deflationary reading of Peirce and James’s many apparent endorsements of correspondence. This reading says they regarded it as a mere platitude or truism, not as a substantive piece of philosophical theorizing. There are two main reasons typically offered in support of this platitude narrative – (1) its consonance with Peirce’s original formulation of PT from 1878, and (2) the objections that pragmatists (including Peirce himself) frequently raised against various notions traditionally associated with CT (e.g. metaphysical realism, representationalism, etc.). I argue that neither reason is compelling and that PT and CT are compatible conceptions of truth.},

We find that, as Hirokawa dramatically showed in a 1996 paper with respect to the rules for implication, the rules for this connective render derivable some new structural rules, even though, unlike the rules for implication, these rules are what we call ipsilateral: applying such a rule does not make any (sub)formula change sides—from the left to the right of the sequent separator or vice versa. Some possibilities for a semantic characterization of the resulting logic are also explored. The paper concludes with three open questions.},

  abstract = {This paper argues for two interrelated claims. The first is that the most innovative contribution of Timothy Williamson, Herman Cappelen, and Max Deutsch (a.k.a., the intuition deniers) in the debate about the epistemology of thought experiments is not the denial of intuition and the claim of the irrelevance of experimental philosophy but the claim of epistemological continuity and the rejection of philosophical exceptionalism. The second is that a better way of implementing the claim of epistemological continuity is not Deutsch and Cappelen’s argument view or Williamson’s folk psychological view (i.e., off-line simulation). This is so because while the argument view makes the basis of the relevant classificational judgement evidentially too demanding; the folk psychological view makes it too weak and error-prone to count as an adequate explanation. Drawing from a certain reading of Aristotle’s Nichomachean Ethics that flowers in Miranda Fricker and John McDowell, I argue for the reason-responsiveness view. Like the extant views, the reason-responsiveness view vindicates the claim of epistemological continuity. But unlike the extant views, it does not share those problematic features. Further, I show that the reason-responsiveness view offers a way for champions of the claim of epistemological continuity to resist Avner Baz’s objection to the claim of epistemological continuity and his objection to the philosophical use of thought experiments while taking on board some attractive elements of his view.},

Heredero del espíritu empirista y utilitarista pero abierto a interpretaciones prácticas de la metafísica y la religión, James reexaminó en esta obra no sólo algunos de los problemas perennes de la filosofía, sino también los desafíos que el evolucionismo y la ciencia moderna planteaban a las viejas concepciones de lo humano y lo divino, la verdad y la libertad. Escrito a caballo entre dos mundos, un pasado puritano que no acababa de morir y un futuro modernista que empezaba a nacer, "Pragmatismo" es un texto sumamente interesante para entender el papel de la filosofía en tiempos convulsos.

  abstract = {This short paper has two loosely connected parts. In the first part, I discuss the difference between classical and intuitionist logic in relation to different the role of hypotheses play in each logic. Harmony is normally understood as a relation between two ways of manipulating formulas in systems of natural deduction: their introduction and elimination. I argue, however, that there is at least a third way of manipulating formulas, namely the discharge of assumption, and that the difference between classical and intuitionist logic can be characterised as a difference of the conditions under which discharge is allowed. Harmony, as ordinarily understood, has nothing to say about discharge. This raises the question whether the notion of harmony can be suitably extended. This requires there to be a suitable fourth way of manipulating formulas that discharge can stand in harmony to. The question is whether there is such a notion: what might it be that stands to discharge of formulas as introduction stands to elimination? One that immediately comes to mind is the making of assumptions. I leave it as an open question for further research whether the notion of harmony can be fruitfully extended in the way suggested here. In the second part, I discuss bilateralism, which proposes a wholesale revision of what it is that is assumed and manipulated by rules of inference in deductions: rules apply to speech acts – assertions and denials – rather than propositions. I point out two problems for bilateralism. First, bilaterlists cannot, contrary to what they claim to be able to do, draw a distinction between the truth and assertibility of a proposition. Secondly, it is not clear what it means to assume an expression such as `+ A that is supposed to stand for an assertion. Worse than that, it is plausible that making an assumption is a particular speech act, as argued by Dummett. Bilaterlists accept that speech acts cannot be embedded in other speech acts. But then it is meaningless to assume + A or - A.},

This conceptual approach to emotion is complemented by several empirical strategies, including the study of emotion dysfunction, the effects of emotions on others, and the relations between emotions and personal and social outcomes. We conclude by considering how functional accounts of emotion vary, including in terms of their level of analysis, specificity, manner of organisation, and range of focus, and the implications functional accounts have for the study of emotion.},

Apart from this, during Peirce’s lectureship at Johns Hopkins University (1879–1883), statistical methods instigated his interest in different theories of the natural conditions of criminality and unconventional behavior in general, and his research into the psychology of great men (W5: 26–106). Benjamin Peirce also nurtured in his son severe intellectual discipline. Combined with Peirce’s logical and mathematical genius, this discipline formed in him a steady habit of self-interpretation―the habit that, with time, developed to the extent that, in one of his letters to his lifelong friend William James, Peirce confessed: “I have been forced to study myself until I have become a devoted seautonologist” (MHFC Peirce to James, 07/16/1907).},

  abstract = {In a Peircean rethinking of the Kantian visual schematisms, as presented in the previous chapter, the visual and the conceptual are closely intertwined. Peirce accepts Kant’s overall treatment of mathematical knowledge, which implies that what is available in ordinary visual experience, already contains pure mathematical intuitions. According to Kant, this is one of the reasons why mathematics is a deductive science. Even if, as Kant says, I construct a geometrical object “in empirical intuition” (on paper), I still do it a priori, without having borrowed the patterns obtained in my construction from any experience (KRV: A714/B742). As a result, we have necessary deductive inferences encoded in our visual perceptions. Peirce uses this result to show that some basic intuitions of ordinary perception can be used in order to visualize mathematical reasoning. Meanwhile, as we discussed in Chapter 7, according to Peirce, visual experience involves unconscious inferences. There is nothing immediate about it, and its very production presupposes a long history of piecemeal adjustments to the environment, where every new encounter is characterized by vagueness and builds on previous sensations (W2: 235). From this perspective, we have images that are conditioned, qua images, by the inferential ties that hold together our linguistic competence.},

  abstract = {Mathematicians apply visual diagrams in their work all the time, whether they want to make special use of Euclid’s fifth postulate, to prove Fermat’s principle, or to extract an algorithm that defines the seemingly chaotic movement of pigeons picking bread crumbs from the ground. Using diagrams helps mathematicians identify patterns that solve particular mathematical problems by making the force of necessary reasoning visually given. An important question, though, is: What is it that a mathematician actually manages to see when using visual diagrammatic representations? A mathematical diagram, a paradigmatic use of which is exemplified in Euclid’s Elements, is an individual image that instantiates necessary relations. A mathematical diagram, therefore, is a relational image of some universal mathematical truth. As such, it has a dual nature. On the one hand, as an observable entity, it allows a mathematician to experiment upon it and to visually demonstrate the necessity of a given conclusion. On the other hand, it represents an abstract mathematical entity that cannot be reduced to a sum total of its particular representations. It follows, then, that a diagram partakes the characteristics of both an individual image observed at this particular instant and an object of a general nature that makes a thing what it is at any particular moment of its existence. In combining the characteristics of individual images and abstractions, diagrams show the essential in a thing at the expense of the features that are less prominent or less relevant to the case. A diagram may thus be considered a visible form (είδος) that, as the Platonic geometers once believed, represents an immediate union of knowing and seeing. But again: Seeing what exactly?},

  abstract = {In order to reform the German idealist tradition without radically undermining it, Kant undertook to reconcile early modern empiricist sense-data theories and classical rationalism. On the one hand, empiricists believed in sense-contents as the pre-theoretical empirical basis of knowledge and in theory-independent data immediately accessible to us in either outer or introspective sensation. According to this view, there are judgements (like “this is red”) that form the basis of empirical knowledge but which themselves are beyond defeat. I simply cannot go wrong when I attentively restrict my judgements to a report of what, as I take it, “appears” to me. On the other hand, rationalists relied on the pre-empirical innate knowledge that, due to its infallibility, could never betray the knower. A piece of wax has certain visible shape, size, color, palpable texture, and smell—all of which change as I move the piece closer to the fire. The only characteristics that remain unchanged are the extension and changeability of the piece, neither of which is perceived directly through the senses or the imagination. On this view, what helps me hold on to the concept of wax and understand what it is, cannot be reduced to senses but can be ultimately achieved by my mind alone. According to Kant, neither of the two views is capable of providing the basis for knowledge separately from the other. Rationalists, in claiming that there are ways in which our concepts are gained independently of sense experience, lose the world as we know it altogether. Empiricists, in claiming that sense experience is the ultimate source of all knowledge, fail to explain how we proceed from perceiving a host of disconnected qualities to having a general idea of an object that possesses those qualities. The former lack experience, while the latter cannot find an explanation for conceptual unity.},

In this respect, mathematical diagrams are like any other language in that the array of possible interpretations provided by their initial construction always exceeds the array of new interpretations suggested by our current goals and points of view. In using diagrams, what we have is, as it were, a system of keyholes, through which we see something only because we do not see all the rest. We can focus on a detail only if the overall picture is vague and, as a whole, available only through the active processes of construction, manipulation, and anticipation.},

The current paper offers a new perspective on the scientific community’s lack of reception to Brouwer’s intuitionism by considering it in light of Michael Friedman’s model of parallel transitions in philosophy and science, specifically focusing on Friedman’s story of Einstein’s theory of relativity. Such a juxtaposition raises onto the surface the differences between Brouwer’s and Einstein’s stories and suggests that contrary to Einstein’s story, the philosophical roots of Brouwer’s intuitionism cannot be traced to any previously established philosophical traditions. The paper concludes by showing how the intuitionistic inclinations of Hermann Weyl and Abraham Fraenkel serve as telling cases of how individuals are involved in setting in motion, adopting, and resisting framework transitions during periods of disagreement within a discipline.},

The paper first argues that such impressions come from long neglect which led to a lack of well-developed, properly tested and reliable reasoning methods, as contrasted with the amount of work generations of mathematicians expended on refining the methods of reasoning with formulae and predicate calculus. Next, two main groups of problems occurring in diagrammatic reasoning are introduced. The second group, called diagram imprecision, is then briefly summarized, its detailed analysis being postponed to another paper. The first group, called collectively the generalization problem, is analyzed in detail in the rest of the paper. The nature and causes of the problems from this group are explained, methods of detecting the potentially harmful occurrences of these problems are discussed, and remedies for possible errors they may cause are proposed. Some of the methods are adapted from similar methods used in reasoning with formulae, several other problems constitute new, specifically diagrammatic ways of reliable reasoning.},

Rumfitt formalises two systems of bilateral logic and gives two arguments for their classical nature. I assess both arguments and conclude that only one system satisfies the meaningtheoretical requirements Rumfitt imposes in his arguments. I then formalise an intuitionist system of bilateral logic which also meets those requirements. Thus Rumfitt cannot claim that only classical bilateral rules of inference succeed in imparting a coherent sense onto the connectives. My system can be extended to classical logic by adding the intuitionistically unacceptable half of a structural rule Rumfitt uses to codify the relation between assertion and denial. Thus there is a clear sense in which, in the bilateral framework, the difference between classicism and intuitionism is not one of the rules of inference governing negation, but rather one of the relation between assertion and denial.},

  abstract = {There is widespread agreement that while on a Dummettian theory of meaning the justified logic is intuitionist, as its constants are governed by harmonious rules of inference, the situation is reversed on Huw Price’s bilateralist account, where meanings are specified in terms of primitive speech acts assertion and denial. In bilateral logics, the rules for classical negation are in harmony. However, as it is possible to construct an intuitionist bilateral logic with harmonious rules, there is no formal argument against intuitionism from the bilateralist perspective. Price gives an informal argument for classical negation based on a pragmatic notion of belief, characterised in terms of the differences they make to speakers’ actions. The main part of this paper puts Price’s argument under close scrutiny by regimenting it and isolating principles Price is committed to. It is shown that Price should draw a distinction between A or ¬A making a difference. According to Price, if A makes a difference to us, we treat it as decidable. This material allows the intuitionist to block Price’s argument. Abandoning classical logic also brings advantages, as within intuitionist logic there is a precise meaning to what it might mean to treat A as decidable: it is to assume A ∨ ¬A.},

But in 1896, he was motivated by his work in set theory to criticize that account of modality, and in 1905 he characterized that criticism as a return "to the Aristotelian doctrine of a real possibility ... the great step that was needed to render pragmaticism an intelligible doctrine." But since Peirce was a realist about modality before 1896, and since he continued defining "possibility" in terms of "states of information" after that date, it is not clear exactly what he changed his mind about. In this essay I explain what it was that Peirce changed his mind about and why, in retrospect, he viewed that change as a decisive step in the development of pragmaticism.},

  abstract = {Abstract: This article explores how Robert Brandom's original “inferentialist” philosophical framework should be positioned with respect to the classical pragmatist tradition. It is argued that Charles Peirce's original attack (in “Questions Concerning Certain Faculties Claimed for Man” and other early papers) on the use of “intuition” in nineteenth-century philosophy of mind is in fact a form of inferentialism, and thus an antecedent relatively unexplored by Brandom in his otherwise comprehensive and illuminating “tales of the mighty dead.” However, whereas Brandom stops short at a merely “strong” inferentialism, which admits some non-inferential mental content (although it is parasitic on the inferential and can only be “inferentially articulated”), Peirce embraces a total, that is, “hyper-,” inferentialism. Some consequences of this difference are explored, and Peirce's more thoroughgoing position is defended.},

I argue that McDowell's advice that the philosophical picture of 'rules as rails' must be abandoned is not sufficient on its own to fully appreciate mathematics' unique blend of creativity and rigor. Rather, we need to understand how Peirce counterposes to the brute compulsion of 'Secondness', both the spontaneity of 'Firstness' and also the rational intelligibility of 'Thirdness'.  This is a written version of a presentation I gave at the “Peirce’s Mathematics” conference, Universidad Nacional de Colombia, November 25-27, 2015, which was organized by Professor Fernando Zalamea. The piece owes much to the inspiration of Prof. Zalamea's writings on philosophy of mathematics.},

  abstract = {Mainstream philosophy has seen a recent flowering in discussions of intellectualism which revisits Gilbert Ryle’s famous distinction between ‘knowing how’ and ‘knowing that’, and challenges his argument that the former cannot be reduced to the latter. These debates so far appear not to have engaged with pragmatist philosophy in any substantial way, which is curious as the relation between theory and practice is one of pragmatism’s main themes. Accordingly, this paper examines the contemporary debate in the light of Charles Peirce’s habit-based epistemology. We argue both that knowing-that can be understood as a particularly sophisticated form of knowing-how, and that all bodily competencies—if sufficiently deliberately developed—can be analysed as instantiating propositional structure broadly conceived. In this way, intellectualism and anti-intellectualism are seen to be not opposed, and both true, although Peirce’s original naturalistic account of propositional structure does lead him to reject what we shall call ‘linguistic intellectualism’.},

  abstract = {Enactivism has influentially argued that the traditional intellectualist ‘act-content’ model of intentionality is insufficient both phenomenologically and naturalistically, and minds are built from world-involving bodily habits—thus, knowledge should be regarded as more of a skilled performance than an informational encoding. Radical enactivists have assumed that this insight must entail non-representationalism concerning at least basic minds. But what if it could be shown that representation is itself a form of skilled performance? I sketch the outline of such an account from the perspective of Peirce’s pragmatist semiotics, which theorises signs as habits of associating specific cues with appropriate acts and schemas of ensuing experience. Within this framework, I argue, a naturalistic account of propositional structure can be constructed which transcends the symbolic—and in some instances even the linguistic—sphere, and offers new insights regarding the Information Processing Challenge, and the Hard Problem of Content.},

  abstract = {It is often argued that by assuming the existence of a universal language, one prohibits oneself from conducting semantical investigations. It could thus be thought that Tarski’s stance towards a universal language in his fruitful Wahrheitsbegriff (1933) differs essentially from Carnap’s in the latter’s less successful Untersuchungen zur allgemeinen Axiomatik (1927–1929). Yet this is not the case. Rather, these two works differ in whether or not the studied fragments of the universal language are languages themselves, i.e., whether or not they are closed under derivation rules. In Carnap’s case, axiom systems are not closed under derivation rules, which enables him to adopt a substitutional concept of models. His approach is directly rooted in the tradition of formal axiomatics, we argue, and in this contrary to Tarski’s. In comparing these works by Carnap and Tarski, our aim will be to qualify the connection between Tarski’s approach and the tradition of formal axiomatics, which has been overemphasized in the literature.},

These texts have not been referred to in the literature before. We provide a complete reconstruction and transcription of these previously unpublished sets of manuscript sheets and analyse their main content. In the reconstructed text, Peirce is seen to outline both a general theory of deduction and a general theory of consequence relation. The two are the cornerstones of modern logic and have played a crucial role in its development. From the wider perspective, Peirce is led to these theories by three important generalizations: propositions to all signs, truth to scriptibility, and derivation to transformability. We provide an exposition of such proposed semiotic foundation for logical constants and point out a couple of further innovations in this rare text, including the sheet of assertion, correction as a dual of deduction and the nature of conditionals as variably strict conditionals.},

  abstract = {Logic is often said to provide norms for thought or reasoning. Indeed, this idea is central to the way in which logic has traditionally been defined as a discipline, and without it, it is not clear how we would distinguish logic from the disciplines that crowd it on all sides: psychology, metaphysics, mathematics, and semantics. But it turns out to be surprisingly hard to say how facts about the validity of inferences relate to norms for reasoning, and some philosophers have concluded that the whole idea is confused. In this talk I will survey a space of possible “bridge principles” connecting logical facts with norms for reasoning. After discussing some considerations relevant to choosing between these bridge principles, I will defend two of them. I will then consider the implications of various choices of bridge principle for the long-standing debates about the roles of relevance, necessity, and formality in our notion of logical consequence.

  abstract = {Abstract             Proof theory is a central area of mathematical logic of special interest to philosophy. It has its roots in the foundational debate of the 1920s, in particular, in Hilbert’s program in the philosophy of mathematics, which called for a formalization of mathematics, as well as for a proof, using philosophically unproblematic, “finitary” means, that these systems are free from contradiction. Structural proof theory investigates the structure and properties of proofs in different formal deductive systems, including axiomatic derivations, natural deduction, and the sequent calculus. Central results in structural proof theory are the normalization theorem for natural deduction, proved here for both intuitionistic and classical logic, and the cut-elimination theorem for the sequent calculus. In formal systems of number theory formulated in the sequent calculus, the induction rule plays a central role. It can be eliminated from proofs of sequents of a certain elementary form: every proof of an atomic sequent can be transformed into a “simple” proof. This is Hilbert’s central idea for giving finitary consistency proofs. The proof requires a measure of proof complexity called an ordinal notation. The branch of proof theory dealing with mathematical systems such as arithmetic thus has come to be called ordinal proof theory. The theory of ordinal notations is developed here in purely combinatorial terms, and the consistency proof for arithmetic presented in detail.},

The purpose of the paper is to examine what could possibly happen to Dummett’s Manifestation Argument within this new programme. After an analysis of the argument, I extract from it a Manifestation Thesis and argue that it fits game semantics, once some basic ideas concerning sense and force in the theory of meaning are reformulated and the second person standpoint is fully taken into account.},

If we are to choose between these logical theories, we require a good understanding of the suitable criteria we ought to judge according to. However, so far there's been a lack of appreciation of how logical practice could support an epistemology of logic. This paper aims to correct that error, by arguing for a practice-based approach to logical epistemology. By looking at the types of evidence logicians actually appeal to in attempting to support their theories, we can provide a more detailed and realistic picture of logical epistemology. To demonstrate the fruitfulness of a practice-based approach, we look to a particular case of logical argumentation—the dialetheist's arguments based upon the self-referential paradoxes—and show that the evidence appealed to support a particular theory of logical epistemology, logical abductivism.},

One of the most prevalent claims made by advocates of AEL is that theory choice within logic is significantly similar to that within the sciences. This connection with scientific methodology highlights a considerable challenge for the anti-exceptionalist, as two uncontentious claims about scientific theories are that they attempt to explain a target phenomenon and (at least partially) prove their worth through successful predictions. Thus, if this methodological AEL is to be viable, the anti-exceptionalist will need a reasonable account of what phenomena logics are attempting to explain, how they can explain, and in what sense they can be said to issue predictions. This paper makes sense of the anti-exceptionalist proposal with a new account of logical theory choice, logical predictivism, according to which logics are engaged in both a process of prediction and explanation.},

Yet, as we show here, this conception of AEL is unhelpful due to both its lack of precision, and its distortion of the current debates. Rather, AEL is better understood as the rejection of certain traditional properties of logic. The picture that results is not of one singular position, but rather a cluster of often connected positions with distinct motivations, understood in terms of their rejection of clusters of the various traditional properties. In order to show the fruitfulness of this new conception of AEL, we distinguish between two prominent versions of the position, metaphysical and epistemological AEL, and show how the two positions need not stand or fall together.},

This distinction clarifies the roles that arguments play in accounting for the normativity of validity for inferential reasoning and in establishing the theoretical connection between validity and logical consequence. There are two related takeaways. First, the normativity of validity for inferential reasoning is grounded on the notion of an inferential argument. This will account for the use of validity to judge inference in the face of well-known skepticism that a theory of validity has any special relevance to inferential reasoning. Second, a valid logcon argument needn't be an inferential argument. Accordingly, the normativity of validity for inferential reasoning doesn't require that every valid logcon argument be an inferential argument. The takeaways harmonize the use of validity to evaluate inferential reasoning with the use of the concept of logical consequence to characterize validity.},

  abstract = {Cheryl Misak Pragmatism and Pluralism 1. Talisse and Aikin argue that pragmatists who take themselves to be pluralists are making a serious mistake. The pluralism in question here is 'deep' pluralism: the view that the persistence of disagreement or conflict is not due to a mistake on someone's part or to human frailty, but is due to the world. I think that Tallise and Aikin are on to something important here. Those pragmatists who take themselves to be pluralists (James, Dewey, Rorty, for instance)1 do indeed turn their backs on something essential to pragmatism. I shall, that is, agree with Talisse and Aiken that pragmatism and a principled, across-the-board pluralism are in tension. Pragmatists cannot be pluralists who enthusiastically hold that the world makes pluralism inevitable. They ought to follow the founder of the doctrine Â— CS. Peirce Â— in being unenrhusiastic about pluralism. Nonetheless Â— and here I part company with Talisse and Aikin Â— pragmatists also ought to follow Peirce in reconciling themselves to the possibility of pluralism's holding here and there. We shall see that, despite this reluctant attitude towards pluralism, the pragmatist can and must celebrate and encourage the diversity of views. 2. The lever on which the pragmatist's position on pluralism turns is the concept of truth. It is unsurprising that James, Dewey, and Rorty take themselves to be pluralists, as they are constantiy tempted by the view that there is no truth Â— only different, equally warranted, accounts of what is the case. Peirce was much more of an objectivist about truth and so it is also unsurprising that he is less keen on pluralism. Peirce argued that a true belief is one which would be indefeasible or one which would stand up to the rigors of inquiry (CP 5.569, 6.485). A true belief is one which is "unassailable by doubt"; it is a belief which would meet every demand we were to place on it (CP 5.416). On this view, truth is a stable property Â— a belief is either true (indefeasible) or not. And truth is not a matter for some particular community Â— if a belief is indefeasible, it would stand up to whatever could be thrown at it, by any community of inquirers. 3. Talisse and Aikin distinguish between meaning pragmatism and inquiry pragmatism. Meaning pragmatism, they say, is roughly: the meaning of a concept lies in its practical consequences. Conflict or disagreement is to be dissolved, not resolved, as it is often a problem about clarifying meaning. Inquiry pragmatism, Transactions of the Charles S.

Resolution, not dissolution, is what we must try to do with conflict. They say that Peirce, along with being a meaning pragmatist, "is an inquiry pragmatist par excellence": he argues that when we are agitated by doubt or conflict, we try to settle belief and get to the truth. The distinction between the two kinds of pragmatism strikes me as being not terribly apt, as meaning pragmatism directly gives rise to inquiry pragmatism. Peirce asks how we determine the meaning of the concept of truth. His "meaning pragmatism" has it that we must see what its implications are for practice. The practice relevant to truth is the practice of inquiry, for truth is what we think we are after when we inquire. So "meaning pragmatism" advises us to look to the practice of inquiry if we want to get a fix on the meaning of truth. Peirce's examination of the practice of inquiry leads him to the view of truth on which truth is indefeasible belief. When we inquire Â— when we search for truth Â— what we do is try to resolve doubt or conflict. Were we to really and permanently resolve doubt or conflict, we would reach the truth. Meaning pragmatism and inquiry pragmatism are thus inextricably bound together. Talisse and Aiken put forward a number of linked arguments about how both meaning pragmatism and inquiry pragmatism are incompatible with deep pluralism. Given that I don't take the distinction between meaning and...},

  abstract = {The most familiar scheme of diagrams used in logic is known as Euler’s circles. It is named after the mathematician Leonhard Euler who popularized it in his Letters to a German Princess (1768). The idea is to use spaces to represent classes of individuals. Charles S. Peirce, who made significant contributions to the theory of diagrams, praised Euler’s circles for their ‘beauty’ which springs from their true iconicity. More than a century later, it is not rare to meet with such diagrams in semiotic literature. They are often offered as instances of icons and are said to represent logic relations as they naturally are. This paper discusses the iconicity of Euler’s circles in three phases: first, Euler’s circles are shown to be icons because their relations imitate the relations of the classes. Then, Euler’s circles themselves, independently of their relations to one another, are shown to be icons of classes. Finally, Euler’s circles are shown to be iconic in the highest degree because they have the relations that they are said to represent. The paper concludes with a note on the so-called naturalness of Euler’s circles.},

  abstract = {Our conscious thought, at least at times, seems suffused with language. We may experience thinking as if we were ‘talking in our head’, thus using inner speech to verbalize, e.g., our premises, lemmas, and conclusions. I take inner speech to be part of a larger phenomenon I call inner semiotics, where inner semiotics involves the subjective experience of expressions in a semiotic (or symbol) system absent the overt articulation of the expressions. In this paper, I argue that inner semiotics allows us to bootstrap our way into entertaining thoughts about exact numbers and quantities that we couldn't prior to our competence with a numeric code. I establish that our arithmetic thoughts literally occur as (internal ‘articulations’ of) expressions in a numeric code. However, a problem arises for my view: just as we can slip in overt speech, producing an utterance that deviates from what we mean to say, there is very good evidence that we can slip in inner speech as well. If our arithmetic thought occurs in a numeric code, it's far from clear how we determine when a covert utterance constitutes a slip. In closing, I provide an account of what makes an inner speech utterance a slip.},

The chapter focuses on what is standardly considered both the most important test case for and the most natural application of IRS: logical inferentialism, the view that the meanings of the logical expressions are fully determined by the basic rules for their correct use, and that to understand a logical expression is to use it in accordance with the appropriate rules. It discusses some of the benefits of logical inferentialism, chiefly with regard to the epistemology of logic, and considers a number of objections. The chapter critically examines Robert Brandom's inferentialism about linguistic and conceptual content in general. Finally, it considers a number of general objections to IRS and possible responses on the inferentialist's behalf.},

She cites cases in which, rather than applying a logical principle to deduce certain implications of our antecedent beliefs, we revise some of those beliefs in the light of their unpalatable consequences. She argues that such instances of, in Gilbert Harman’s phrase, ‘reasoned change in view’ cannot be accommodated by the dispositionalist approach, and that we would do well to conceive of logical knowledge as a species of propositional knowledge instead. In this paper, we propose a dispositional account that is more general than the one Besson considers, viz. one that does not merely apply to beliefs, and claim that dispositionalists have the resources to account for reasoned change in view. We then raise what we take to be more serious challenges for the dispositionalist view, and sketch some lines of response dispositionalists might offer.},

Two key proof-theoretic requirements on admissible logical rules, harmony and separability, directly stem from this thesis—requirements, however, that standard single-conclusion and assertion-based formalizations of classical logic provably fail to satisfy (Dummett in The logical basis of metaphysics, Harvard University Press, Harvard, MA, 1991; Prawitz in Theoria, 43:1–40, 1977; Tennant in The taming of the true, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1997; Humberstone and Makinson in Mind 120(480):1035–1051, 2011). On the plausible assumption that our logical practice is both single-conclusion and assertion-based, it seemingly follows that classical logic, unlike intuitionistic logic, can’t be accounted for in inferentialist terms. In this paper, I challenge orthodoxy and introduce an assertion-based and single-conclusion formalization of classical propositional logic that is both harmonious and separable. In the framework I propose, classicality emerges as a structural feature of the logic.},

Human habits as habits of thought, action, and feeling and perception are phenomena of Firstness, Secondness, and Thirdness. With human habits, the habits of nature share the feature of plasticity.

In this paper, I start by discussing four philosophical issues pertaining to reductio arguments. I then briefly present a dialogical conceptualization of deductive arguments, according to which such arguments (especially mathematical proofs) are best understood as a dialogue between two (fictitious) participants—Prover and Skeptic. Finally, I argue that many of the philosophical and cognitive difficulties surrounding reductio arguments are dispelled or at least further clarified once one adopts a dialogical perspective.},

Whereas Peirce managed to bring the graphical systems of Alpha and Beta Graphs to a high degree of perfection, his treatment of the Gamma Graphs remained tentative and unfinished.

It is, however, clear that Peirce with his Gamma Graphs was aiming at a complicated system in which one can deal with a number of interesting problems regarding various kinds of modality.

In particular, we discuss 1) the topological properties of time, 2) the implicative structure in tense logic, 3) the notions of open future and branching time models, and finally 4) tenselogical alternatives to branching time models.},

One of the topics that caught his attention was Peirce's existential graphs. This interest continued when he returned to England. In this paper Prior's grappling with the existential graphs will be discussed.}

  abstract = {This paper thematically analyzes Charles Sanders Peirce’s doctrine of fallibilism. Peirce’s fallibilism is best construed as an epistemic thesis that tries to correct the excesses of and mediate between Cartesian dogmatism and skepticism. Hence, as a theory of epistemic justification, it is neither overly confident like foundationalism nor overarchingly cynic like skepticism. It grants the possibility for knowledge, yet, this knowledge is not foregrounded on absolute warrants. The paper therefore argues that, it is at this juncture that the theory runs into the problem of vagueness: if we are not certain at which particular point a given piece of information becomes knowledge, how can we know we have arrived at it yet? Subsequently, Peirce’s novel introduction of hope (as an epistemic principle) and the self-corrective nature of inquiry makes his theory more convincing. Thus, we do not need to worry about arriving at the knowledge, because doubt necessitates inquiry which in turn is self-corrective. So, the more the inquiry, the surer we are of arriving at knowledge.},

While CM works as ST at the inferential level, it also recovers every classically valid metainference. Moreover, CM can be safely expanded with a transparent truth predicate. Nevertheless, CM cannot recapture every classically valid meta-metainference. We will afterwards develop a hierarchy of consequence relations CMn for metainferences of level n (for 1 ≤ n {$<$} ω). Each CMn recovers every metainference of level n or less, and can be nontrivially expanded with a transparent truth predicate, but cannot recapture every classically valid metainferences of higher levels. Finally, we will present a logic CMω, based on the hierarchy of logics CMn, that is fully classical, in the sense that every classically valid metainference of any level is valid in it.

  abstract = {Natural deduction is the type of logic most familiar to current philosophers, and indeed is all that many modern philosophers know about logic. Yet natural deduction is a fairly recent innovation in logic, dating from Gentzen and Jaśkowski in 1934. This article traces the development of natural deduction from the view that these founders embraced to the widespread acceptance of the method in the 1960s. I focus especially on the different choices made by writers of elementary textbooks—the standard conduits of the method to a generation of philosophers—with an eye to determining what the ‘essential characteristics’ of natural deduction are.},

  abstract = {The topic of this paper is the question whether there is a logic which could be justly called the logic of inference. It may seem that at least since Prawitz, Dummett and others demonstrated the proof-theoretical prominency of intuitionistic logic, the forthcoming answer is that it is this logic that is the obvious choice for the accolade. Though there is little doubt that this choice is correct (provided that inference is construed as inherently single-conclusion and complying with the Gentzenian structural rules), I do not think that the usual justification of it is satisfactory. Therefore, I will first try to clarify what exactly is meant by the question, and then sketch a conceptual framework in which it can be reasonably handled. I will introduce the concept of ‘inferentially native’ logical operators (those which explicate inferential properties) and I will show that the axiomatization of these operators leads to the axiomatic system of intuitionistic logic. Finally, I will discuss what modifications of this answer enter the picture when more general notions of inference are considered.},

  abstract = {Logic is usually presented as a tool of rational inquiry; however, many logicians in fact treat logic so that it does not serve us, but rather governs us – as rational beings we are subordinated to the logical laws we aspire to disclose. We denote the view that logic primarily serves us as logica serviens, while denoting the thesis that it primarily governs our reasoning as logica dominans. We argue that treating logic as logica dominans is misguided, for it leads to the idea of a “genuine” logic within a “genuine” language. Instead of this, we offer a naturalistic picture, according to which the only languages that exist are the natural languages and the artificial languages logicians have built. There is, we argue, no language beyond these, especially none that would be a wholesome vehicle of reasoning like the natural languages and yet be transparently rigorous like the artificial ones. Logic is a matter of using the artificial languages as idealized models of the natural ones, whereby we pinpoint the laws of logic by means of zooming in on a reflective equilibrium.},

Inthe second part, the doctrine of games as explanations for logic isassessed, and the relevance of a conceptual analysis of games tocognition discussed.

I conclude that the latter, which was Peirce's original formulation, is methodologically the more tolerant of the two and hence embraces pluralism over and above pragmatism.},

Pietarinen’s book Signs of Logic (2006) and Stjernfelt’s book Diagrammatology (2007) were both published in the same Synthese Library Series being published by Springer. The two books also share the common topic of diagrammatic reasoning in Charles Peirce’s work. Beginning in a conference Applying Peirce held in Helsinki in conjunction with the World Congress of Semiotics in June 2007, two authors have commented upon these books under the headline of Synthese Library Book Session on several occasions, including the Aarhus meeting on Signs and Meaning held in February 2008, the Diagrammatology and Diagram Praxis workshop in Lisboa in March 2009, and the Peirce and Early Analytic Philosophy symposium in Helsinki in June 2009. Therefore, these two review papers form a continuing discussion on the contributions Peirce’s diagrammatic epistemology and logic will have to a broad range of issues at the intersections of philosophy, logic, cognitive sciences and beyond.},

  abstract = {Einstein famously said, “Imagination is more important than knowledge”. But how to study imagination and how to represent and communicate what the content of imagination may be in the context of scientific discovery? In 1908 Peirce stated that deduction consists of “two sub-stages”, logical analysis and mathematical reasoning. Mathematical reasoning is further divisible into “corollarial and theorematic reasoning”, the latter concerning an invention of a new icon, or “imaginary object diagram”, while the former results from “previous logical analyses and mathematically reasoned conclusions”. The iconic moment is clearly stated here, as well as the imaginative character of theorematic reasoning. But translating propositions into a suitable diagrammatic language is also needed: A diagram is for Peirce “a concrete but possibly changing mental image of such a thing as it represents”. “A model”, he held, “may be employed to aid the imagination; but the essential thing to be performed is the act of imagining” (MS 616, 1906). Peirce had observed that the importance of imagination in scientific investigation is in supplying an inquirer, not with any fiction but, in quite stark contrast to what fiction is, with “an inkling of truth”. Since Peirce’s limit notion of truth precludes gaining any direct insight into the truth, in rational inquiry the question of what the truth may be or what it could be needs to be tackled by imagination. This imaginative faculty is aided by diagrams which are iconic in nature. The inquirers who imagine the truth “dream of explanations and laws”. Imagination becomes a crucial part of the method for attaining truth, that is, of the logic of science and scientific inquiry, so much so that Peirce took it that “next after the passion to learn there is no quality so indispensable to the successful prosecution of science as imagination”. In this paper we investigate aspects of scientific reasoning and discovery that seem irreplaceably dependent on a Peircean understanding of imagination, abductive reasoning and diagrammatic representations.},

The argument has two parts: the ineliminability of leading principles, and the presence of non-deductive components in deduction. We expose this argument and analyse it in the light of Peirce's theory of three kinds of reasoning, their respective justifications, and the character of leading principles as habits of reasoning. We observe that the element of observation involved in deduction brings in theoric steps, and identify abductive moments in the derivation of the rules of deductive reasoning. This shows the presence of elements of observation in Peirce's leading principle of inference, which is residuation.},

As a method of ‘putting questions to our minds,’ it assigns meanings to signs in terms of conceivable practical consequences for rational conduct. Questions are experiments on various ways of finding solutions in thoughts. This paper proposes pragmaticism as a logical method to study consciousness. In particular, perceptions of relations of differences create a “temporal contract” between states of minds that give rise to experiences. Peirce’s “dyadic consciousness” is this drafting of a contract between states of mind, anticipating and occasionally furthering beyond the key notions of 4E cognitive science.},

An explanation of computation that does not take this semiotic dimension into account is incomplete. Semiosis is essential to computation and therefore requires a rigorous definition. To prove this thesis, the author analyzes two concepts of computation: the Turing machine and the mechanistic conception of physical computation. The paper is organized in two parts. The first part (Sects.~2 and 3) develops a re-interpretation of the Turing machine starting from Peirce’s semiotics. The author shows how this reinterpretation allows overcoming the dualism between a purist and a realist version of the Turing machine. The second part of the paper (Sect.~4) shows how a mechanistic explanation of physical computation such as the one developed by Piccinini is incomplete without considering semiotic relations. The paper intends to be a contribution to the philosophical debate on computation.},

First, though the dominant conception of nature was such that there was no room for power in bodies, the very idea that laws govern the behaviour of (bits of) matter in motion brought with it the following issue, which came under sharp focus in the work of Leibniz: how possibly can passive matter, devoid of power, obey laws? Though Leibniz?s answer was to re-introduce powers, two radically different conceptualisations of the relation between laws and powers became available after him. Hume denied powers altogether, whereas Newton thought that to introduce a power is to introduce a law. The second main point will be that though laws were meant to replace powers, the real dilemma ended up being not laws vs powers, but rather necessity vs non-necessity in nature. To exploit, an expression used by Newton, the question was: what is the place of necessity in the frame of nature?}

While our aim here will be to present the main technical and philosophical features of what can be seen as the dialogical approach to logic, illustrated through both very well known and new dialogics, we would also like to delineate the common pragmatic attitude which constitutes the cohesive force within the dialogical universe.",

For classical proposi-tional logic and for classical first-order logic, an exact connection between ‘in-tuitionistic dialogues with hypotheses’ and semantic games is established. Various questions of a philosophical nature are also shown to arise as a result of the comparison, among them the relation between the model-theoretic and proof-theoretic approaches to the philosophy of logic and mathematics.},

In this paper we explore the connexion between dialogues and natural deduction, an area that is much less understood. We define a system of dialogical games that captures the notion of valid- ity of Johansson's minimal logic, and show how to extend the system for intuitionistic and classical logic. Then we describe an algorithm that transforms a dialogical proof into a Fitch-style natural deduction proof, and discuss the relation between the two approaches.},

  abstract = {Development of decision-support and intelligent agent systems necessitates mathematical descriptions of uncertainty and fuzziness in order to model vagueness. This paper seeks to present an outline of Peirce’s triadic logic as a practical new way to model vagueness in the context of artificial intelligence (AI). Charles Sanders Peirce (1839–1914) was an American scientist–philosopher and a great logician whose triadic logic is a culmination of the study of semiotics and the mathematical study of anti-Cantorean model of continuity and infinitesimals. After presenting Peircean semiotics within AI perspective, a mathematical formulation of a Peircean triadic set is given in relationship with classical and fuzzy sets. Using basic logical operators, all possible respective implication operators, bi-equivalence operators, valid rules of inference, and associative, distributive and commutative logical properties are derived and verified through the truth function approach. In order to suggest practical directions, aggregation operators for Peirce’s triadic logic have been formulated. A mathematical formulation of a medical diagnostic problem and ER diagram of a library management system using Peirce’s triadic relation show potential for further applications of the proposed triadic set and triadic logic. Alongside, a classical AI game—The Wumpus World—is implemented to show practical efficacy in comparison with binary implementation. Besides giving some preliminary formulations for trichotomous set theory and definition of finite automaton, development of hybrid architectures for intelligent agents and evolutionary computations are discussed as potential practical avenues for Peirce’s triadic logic.},

Scientific theories cannot be asserted as true categorically, but only as having some probability of being true. Fallibilists insist on our inability to attain the final and definitive truth regarding the theoretical concerns of natural science – in particular at the level of theoretical physics. At any rate, at this level of generality and precision each of our accepted beliefs may turn out to be false, and many of them will. Fallibilism does not insist on the falsity of our scientific claims but rather on their tentativity as inevitable estimates: it does not hold that knowledge is unavailable here, but rather that it is always provisional.},

Logical theories can be used descriptively (for example, to represent particular arguments or to depict the logical form of certain sentences). Here the logician uses the usual methods of empirical science to assess the correctness of his descriptions. However, the most important applications of logical theories are normative, and here, I argue, the epistemology is that of wide reflective equilibrium. The result is that logic not only assesses our inferential practice but also changes it. I tie my discussion to Thagard's views concerning the relationship between psychology and logic, arguing against him that psychology has and should have only a peripheral role in normative (and most descriptive) applications of logic.}

However, they do not think we should give up our beliefs in light of these skeptical conclusions. Rather, we should retain them, since we have good practical reasons for doing so. This takes the sting out of skepticism: we can be skeptics, of a kind, without thereby succumbing to practical or intellectual disaster. I respond to objections, and compare the position of the Pragmatic Skeptic to views found in the work of (among others) David Hume, William James, David Lewis, Berislav Marušić, and Robert Pasnau.},

Aun cediendo el punto central del problema (hay principios lógicos inadoptables), argumentamos que no solo puede salvaguardarse la posibilidad de modificar racionalmente nuestra teoría lógica, sino también la de razonar deductivamente siguiendo nuevos patrones inferenciales. Es decir, consideramos que el dilema kripkeano alcanza únicamente para rechazar la posibilidad de adoptar ciertos principios lógicos, así como de razonar de acuerdo a ellos según una noción específica de “adopción”, pero no anula la posibilidad de adquirirlos mediante otros mecanismos a los que llamamos “adquisición por inmersión” y “adquisición por decodificación”.},

  abstract = {In the literature on self-referential paradoxes one of the hardest and most challenging problems is that of revenge. This problem can take many shapes, but, typically, it besets non-classical accounts of some semantic notion, such as truth, that depend on a set of classically defined meta-theoretic concepts, like validity, consistency, and so on. A particularly troubling form of revenge that has received a lot of attention lately involves the concept of validity. The difficulty lies in that the non-classical logician cannot accept her own definition of validity because it is given in a classical meta-theory. It is often suggested that this mismatch between the consequence relation of the account being espoused and the consequence relation of the meta-theory is a serious embarrassment. The main goal of the paper is to explore whether certain substructural accounts of the paradoxes can avoid this sort of embarrassment. Typically, these accounts are expressively incomplete, since they cannot assert in the object language that certain invalid arguments are in fact invalid. To overcome this difficulty I develop a novel type of hybrid proof-procedure, one that takes invalidities to be just as fundamental as validities. I prove that this proof-procedure enjoys a number of interesting properties and I analyze the prospects of applying it to languages capable of expressing self-referential statements.},

Although we usually identify the concept of validity with (classical first-order) logical validity and, in turn, we typically take this to capture the notion of necessary preservation of truth in virtue of logical form, this is just one way in which validity can be explained. A different understanding of the notion of validity that has received some attention recently is based on the idea that an argument is valid just in case accepting its premises is incoherent with rejecting its conclusion. The main claim of the paper will be that, under this understanding of the notion of validity, the usual reasons to privilege a treatment of validities over a treatment of invalidities loose much of their force. Validity and invalidity are on a par, which means that there are no strong reasons to treat validities primitively and to define invalidities in terms of them.},

  abstract = {Non-classical logicians do not typically reject classically valid logical principles across the board. In fact, they sometimes suggest that their preferred logic recovers classical reasoning in most circumstances. This idea has come to be known in the literature as ‘classical recapture’. Recently, classical logicians have raised various doubts about it. The main problem is said to be that no rigorous explanation has been given of how is it exactly that classical logic can be recovered. The goal of the paper is to address this problem. First, I discuss a number of different ways to characterize the idea of classical recapture and I examine how far it can be pushed. Secondly, I argue that a palatable form of classical recapture is given by the thought that classical logic can be retained for statements that are grounded (in Kripke's sense). To substantiate this view I provide a formal fixed-point semantics for a language containing a predicate standing for the concept of groundedness and I address a couple of objections that have been deployed against the claim that classical recapture can aid the non-classical logician's cause.},

The conception of logic focused on emphasises the traditional role of logic as a methodology for the sciences, which distinguishes it from other sciences that are not methodological. On the proposed conception, the methodological aims of logic drive its definitions and principles, rather than the description of scientific phenomena. The notion of a methodological discipline is explained as a relation between disciplines or practices. Logic serves as a methodological discipline with respect to any theoretical practice, and this generality, as well as logic’s reflexive nature, distinguish it from other methodological disciplines. Finally, the evolution of model theory is taken as a case study, with a focus on its methodological role. Following recent work by John Baldwin and Juliette Kennedy, we look at model theory from its inception in the mid-twentieth century as a foundational endeavour until developments at the end of the century, where the classification of theories has taken centre-stage.},

These notes are today recognized as one of the first attempts to create non-classical formal systems. However, besides the articles published by Turquette in the 1970s and 1980s, very little progress has been made toward a comprehensive understanding of the formal aspects of Peirce's triadic logic (as he called it). This paper aims to propose a new approach to Peirce's matrices for three-valued propositional logic. We suggested that his logical matrices give rise to three different systems, one of them - which we called P3 - is an original and non-explosive logic. Besides that, we will show that the P3 system can easily be transformed into paraconsistent and paracomplete calculi, adding to it, respectively, unary operators of consistency and intuitionistic negation. We conclude with a discussion about philosophical motivations.},

In the process, they have thrown open the door to a hitherto unrecognized domain of non-classical logics with surprising intrinsic properties, as well as subtle and interesting relations to various familiar logics, including classical logic. One such result is that, for each natural number n, there is a logic which agrees with classical logic on tautologies, inferences, meta-inferences, meta-meta-inferences, meta-meta-...(n - 3 times)-meta-inferences, but that disagrees with classical logic on n + 1-meta-inferences. They suggest that this shows that classical logic can only be characterized by defining its valid inferences at all orders. In this article, I invoke some simple symmetric generalizations of BPS’s results to show that the problem is worse than they suggest, since in fact there are logics that agree with classical logic on inferential validity to all orders but still intuitively differ from it. I then discuss the relevance of these results for truth theory and the classification problem.},

He eventually holds that each sign has two objects and three interpretants, standardizing quickly on immediate and dynamical (or real) for the~objects but experimenting with a variety of names for the interpretants. The two~most prominent terminologies are immediate/dynamical/final and emotional/energetic/logical, and scholars have long debated how they are related to each other. This paper seeks to shed new light on the matter by reviewing the numerous manuscript drafts where Peirce develops the latter nomenclature while attempting to introduce his pragmatism to a general audience. It then goes on to examine an additional set of interpretants, intentional/effectual/communicational, and shows that the three different trichotomies can be understood as complementary, rather than redundant or conflicting.},

Although it can be adapted to various modern modal logics, Zeman demonstrates that making no other changes results in a version that he calls Gamma-MR, an implementation of Jan Łukasiewicz's four-valued Ł-modal system. It disallows the assertion of necessity, reflecting a denial of determinism, and has theorems involving possibility that seem counterintuitive at first glance. However, the latter is a misconception that arises from overlooking the distinction between the intermediate truth values (ITVs) that are assigned to possibly true propositions as either X-contingent or Y-contingent. Any two propositions having the same ITV are possible together, while any two propositions having different ITVs, including those that are each other's negation, are possible individually yet not possible together. Porte shows that Ł-modal can be translated into classical logic by defining a constant for each ITV such that its implication of another proposition asserts the latter's possibility, while its conjunction with another proposition asserts the latter's necessity. These are expressed in the Alpha part of EG without broken cuts, simplifying derivations and shedding further light on Łukasiewicz's system, as long as graphs including either of the constants are properly interpreted. Ł-modal and Gamma-MR thus capture the two-sided nature of possibility as the limit between truth and falsity in Peirce's triadic conception.},

  abstract = {Charles Peirce incorporates modality into his Existential Graphs (EG) by introducing the broken cut for possible falsity. Although it can be adapted to various modern modal logics, Zeman demonstrates that making no other changes results in a version that he calls Gamma-MR, an implementation of Jan Łukasiewicz's four-valued Ł-modal system. It disallows the assertion of necessity, reflecting a denial of determinism, and has theorems involving possibility that seem counterintuitive at first glance. However, the latter is a misconception that arises from overlooking the distinction between the intermediate truth values (ITVs) that are assigned to possibly true propositions as either X-contingent or Y-contingent. Any two propositions having the same ITV are possible together, while any two propositions having different ITVs, including those that are each other's negation, are possible individually yet not possible together. Porte shows that Ł-modal can be translated into classical logic by defining a constant for each ITV such that its implication of another proposition asserts the latter's possibility, while its conjunction with another proposition asserts the latter's necessity. These are expressed in the Alpha part of EG without broken cuts, simplifying derivations and shedding further light on Łukasiewicz's system, as long as graphs including either of the constants are properly interpreted. Ł-modal and Gamma-MR thus capture the two-sided nature of possibility as the limit between truth and falsity in Peirce's triadic conception.},

  abstract = {With his Introduction to Operative Logic and Mathematics1, which first appeared in 1955, Paul Lorenzen became an exponent of an approach to the foundations of logic and mathematics, which is both formalistic and intuitionistic in spirit. Formalistic because its basis is the purely syntactical handling of symbols—or ‘figures’, as Lorenzen preferred to say —, and intuitionistic because the insight into the validity of admissibility statements justifies the laws of logic. It is also intuitionistic with respect to its result, as Heyting’s formalism of intuitionistic logic is legitimatised this way. Along with taking formal calculi as its basis, the notion of an inductive definition becomes fundamental. Together with a theory of abstraction and the idea of transfinitely interating inductive definitions, Lorenzen devised a novel foundation for mathematics, many aspects of which still deserve attention. When he wrote his Operative Logic, neither a full-fledged theory of inductive definitions nor a proof-theoretic semantics for logical constants was available. A decade later, Lorenzen’s inversion principle was used and extended by Prawitz (Prawitz 1965) in his theory of natural deduction, and in the 1970s, the idea of inversion was used for a logical semantics in terms of proofs by Dummett, Martin-Löf, Prawitz and others. Prawitz and others. Another aspect which makes Lorenzen’ theory interesting from a modern point of view, is that in his protologic he anticipated certain views of rule-based reasoning and free equality which much later became central to the theory of resolution and logic programming.},

  abstract = {This paper compares two ways of holding that logic is special among the sciences in that it has no restricted class of entities as its subject matter, but instead concerns all entities alike. One way is Williamson’s explanation of how inquiry into logical consequence and logical truth only superficially concerns the linguistic or conceptual entities that bear these properties. Williamson draws on ideas familiar from deflationism about truth, and his account has been called “deflationary.” I argue that the analogy is misleading. While there’s a broad sense in which Williamson offers a deflationary account of logical inquiry, his view differs from deflationism about truth in being best understood as a form of instrumentalism. By contrast, I elaborate a deflationism about logical properties modeled on deflationism about truth. I defend this expressive device deflationism as an explanation of our use of logical predicates.},

  abstract = {Charles Sanders Peirce was a philosopher, but it is not easy toclassify him in philosophy because of the breadth of his work. (Pleaserefer to the table of contents of the entry Charles Sanders Peirce.) Logic was one of the main topics on which Peirce wrote. If we focuson logic, however, it becomes apparent that both Peirce’sconcept of logic and his work on logic were much broader than hispredecessors’, his contemporaries’, and ours. First,Peirce located logic in his large architectonic framework ofphilosophy, which is why some strongly believe that Peirce’slogic cannot be properly understood without understanding hispragmatism and his semiotics, to mention but two of his othercontributions. Even within the traditional boundaries of logic, Peircemade too many contributions to outline in a single article., Acknowledging the nature of this next-to-impossible task, we singleout the common theme of Peirce’s various contributions to modernlogic—to extend logic, as characterized by the three differentdimensions: , The main goal of this entry is not only to present Peirce’saccomplishments in each of these three extensions, but also to explorethe relations, if any, among these novel developments. The threesections of the entry will be devoted, respectively, to each of thesethree ways how the horizon of deductive logic is expanded byPeirce., Peirce’s journey on formal deductive logic started with Booleancalculus and De Morgan’s logic of relatives. Boolean algebracreated a path to generalize Aristotelian syllogism and DeMorgan’s ambition to formalize relations opened a new territoryto conquer. However, Peirce’s predicate logic is neither amechanical expansion from the existing logics nor a simple combinationof these two. A leap made by Peirce from his contemporary logic isqualitatively substantial enough to call Peirce a founder of moderndeductive logic, as the entry explains. The first section exploresPeirce’s development of predicate logic presented in his severalwell-known papers, by locating the root of Peirce’s introductionof quantifiers and bound variables. While formal details and notationsof Peirce’s first-order logic can be overwhelming, one shouldnot lose the sight of the bigger picture by paying attention to themain motivation behind Peirce’s enterprise for a new logic.Conquering new territory—relations—with new formalnotation, Peirce’s adventure was launched into anotherdimension—a new mode of representation, that is, diagrammaticrepresentation. This is the topic of the second section. While twosystems of Peirce’s Existential Graphs (“EG”henceforth) are presented, the following perspective is at thebackground: Peirce’s EG were not invented just as randomalternatives, logically equivalent to his own predicate logicalnotation, but a reflection of Peirce’s new approach to logic andformalization. As Peirce’s tireless attempts for predicate logicbrought to us more powerful formal notation, Peirce’s search forbetter representation of relational states of affairs was pursuedbeyond his own symbolic system. Spatial, as opposed to linear,notation is still not familiar to some of us, and the second sectionintroduces the basic notational aspects of Peirce’s EG, anddiscusses the fundamental differences between EG and symbolic systems.The third section about three-valued logic examines another newenterprise of Peirce, not in syntactic notation, but in semanticvalues. Peirce scholars propose various motivations behindPeirce’s three value semantics and those different views will bebriefly discussed., While the first contribution, that is, an extension from monadic topredicate logic, has positioned Peirce as a founder of modern logicalong with Frege, it took much longer for Peirce’s otherachievements to receive proper attention from logicians orphilosophers. The entry aims to draw a road map for Peirce’sjourney in deductive logic so that one may realize his accomplishmentsare very much connected with each other. More specifically,Peirce’s achievements in deductive logic were accumulative.After being able to formalize polyadic relations with new symbolicnotation, Peirce devised a totally new form ofrepresentation—diagrammatic systems. What we can formalize isextended and how we can formalize what we can formalize isextended. And Peirce ventured into what our formalization representsand suggested a more fine-grained or a bigger territory of semanticvalues than binary True or False values.}

Instead they are social objects formed by a community's employment of language. So it is the public use of sentences that settles what they mean, and thereby their logic.

  abstract = {Peirce developed the algebraic notation for first-order and higher-order predicate calculus in 1885. In 1897, he developed the graphic notation for existential graphs (EGs), which have the full expressive power of his algebra. Section 1 of this article introduces existential graphs in the form he preferred in his later years (1906 to 1911). Section 2 presents the grammar for the Existential Graph Interchange Format (EGIF), which is a linear notation that has the full expressive power of the ISO standard 24707 for Common Logic (CL). The examples in Section 1 show how the FOL features of EGs are mapped to EGIF and to predicate calculus. That mapping is sufficient to determine the semantics of EGs that express FOL. For the semantics of Peirce’s extensions beyond FOL, EGIF can also serve as a tool for analyzing and clarifying his many variations. This article contains graphics, excerpts, and adaptations from various publications by the author. For sources, see the references at the end.},

  abstract = {The so-called semantics of elementary logic (predicate logic of first order) has some peculiarities which may be considered as disadvantages, at least if looked at from a certain point of view. First of all, it makes use of a very strong set-theoretical apparatus which is highly non-constructive. Strict constructivism may not be obtainable for a semantic foundation of logic; but even if one does not subscribe to constructivism one should expect that a weaker apparatus would be sufficient to define logical validity or logical implication on the elementary level. Secondly, this set-theoretical approach is restricted to classical logic and can therefore not be used, e.g. to define a concept of validity for intuitionistic logic or other logical systems differing from the classical one. This fact will not be considered as a drawback by those for whom classical logic is the only ‘real’ logic. On the other hand ‘classicists’ as well as ‘intuitionists’ should welcome an account of logic with the help of which different logical systems can be compared on the basis of semantical concepts alone — an account in which the deviations of logical systems from each other would be mirrored by different concepts of validity. Thirdly there are two characteristics of this semantics based upon the Bolzano-Tarski approach which in various contexts have been the main points of attack in the arguments of intuitionists and constructivists against this approach (which are mistakenly thought to be arguments against classical logic): (a) the procedure of introducing logical connectives as truth-functions tacitly presupposes that every meaningful sentence is either true or false (true-false-alternative). In view of such unproved and unrefuted sentences as ‘there is at least one odd perfect number’ one can reasonably doubt whether this assumption is correct. Namely if one decides to identify in mathematical contexts ‘true with ‘provable’ and ‘false’ with ‘refutable’ it is certainly not justified. And if one does not accept this identification then if one doesn’t want to destroy the meaning of ‘true’ altogether it seems hardly possible to do without some kind of ‘ontological hypothesis’ about the pre-existence of numbers or other kinds of mathematical entities; but the best that can be said about},

Logical inferentialism is the position that the meanings of the logical constants are determined by the rules of inference they obey. As such, logical inferentialism requires a proof-theoretic framework within which to operate. However, in order to fulfil its semantic duties, a deductive system has to be suitably connected to our inferential practices. I argue that, contrary to an established tradition, multiple-conclusion systems are ill-suited for this purpose because they fail to provide a `natural' representation of our ordinary modes of inference. Moreover, the two most plausible attempts at bringing multiple conclusions into line with our ordinary forms of reasoning , the disjunctive reading and the bilateralist denial interpretation, are unacceptable by inferentialist standards.},

I begin by contrasting Carnap’s conception of the normativity of logic with that of his teacher, Frege. I identify two core features of Frege’s position: first, the normative force of the logical laws is grounded in their descriptive adequacy; second, norms implied by logic are constitutive for thinking as such (in a sense to be clarified). While Carnap breaks with Frege’s absolutism about logic and hence with the notion that any system of logic should have a privileged claim to correctness, I argue that there is a sense in which Carnap’s framework-relative conception of logical norms has a constitutive role to play: though they are not constitutive for the conceptual activity for thinking, they do nevertheless set the ground rules that make certain forms of scientific inquiry possible in the first place. I~conclude that Carnap’s principle of tolerance is tamer than one might have thought and that, despite remaining differences, Frege’s and Carnap’s conceptions of logic have more in common than one might have thought.},

Gilbert Harman challenged the view that there is any straightforward connection between logical consequence and norms of reasoning. Authors including John MacFarlane and Hartry Field have sought to rehabilitate the traditional view. I argue that the debate is marred by a failure to distinguish three types of normative assessment, and hence three ways to understand the question of the normativity of logic. Logical principles might be thought to provide the reasoning agent with first-personal directives; they might be thought to serve as third-personal evaluative standards; or they might underwrite our third-personal appraisals of others whereby we attribute praise and blame. I characterize the three normative functions in general terms and show how a failure to appreciate this threefold distinction has led disputants to talk past one another. I further show how the distinction encourages fruitful engagement with and, ultimately, resolution of the question.},

In both cases there is afailure to conform one’s attitudes to logical strictures. Wegenerally take agents who fall short of the demands of logic to berationally defective. This suggests that logic has a normative role toplay in our rational economy; it instructs us how we ought or oughtnot to think or reason. The notion that logic has such a normativerole to play is deeply anchored in the way we traditionally thinkabout and teach logic. To consider just two examples, Kantcharacterizes what he calls “pure general” logic asembodying the “absolutely necessary rules of thought withoutwhich there can be no employment whatsoever of theunderstanding” (A52/B76), which instruct us not “how theunderstanding is and thinks” but “how it ought toproceed” (Kant 1974 [1800]: 16). Similarly, Frege, in hisvehement opposition to the psychologistic tendencies of his time,classifies logic, “like ethics” as a “normativescience” (Frege 1897/1979: 228), one whose laws “prescribeuniversally how one should think if one is to think at all”(Frege 1893/1903/2009: xv). This entry is concerned with the questionas to whether the tradition and the intuitions that appear tounderwrite it are correct. In other words, it is concerned with thequestion as to whether logic has normative authority over us. And ifit does, in what sense exactly it can be said to do so?}

  abstract = {A number of criteria for discriminating diagrammatic from sentential systems of representation by their manner of semantic interpretation have been proposed. Often some sort of spatial homomorphism between diagram and its referent is said to distinguish diagrammatic from sentential systems (e.g. Barwise \& Etchemendy 1990). Or the distinction is analysed in terms of Peirce's distinctions between symbol, icon and index (see Shin (forthcoming)). Shimojima (1999) has proposed that the sharing of 'nomic' constraints between representing and represented relations is what distinguishes diagrams. We have proposed that the fundamental distinction is between direct and indirect systems of representation, where indirect systems have an abstract syntax interposed between representation and represented entities (Stenning \& Inder 1994; Gurr, Lee \& Stenning 1999; Stenning \& Lemon (in press). The purpose of the present paper is to relate the distinction between directness and indirectness to the other criteria, and to further develop the approach through a comparison Peirce's Existential Graphs both with sentential logics and with diagrammatics ones. Peirce's system is a particularly interesting case because its semantics can be viewed as either direct or indirect according to the level of interpretation. The paper concludes with some remarks on the consequences of sentential vs. diagrammatic modalities for the conduct of proof.},

Most of these developments occur in the mature Peirce after the turn of the century and thus form an important part of his mature semiotics – yet, they do not relate in any simple or straight-forward manner to his attempts at enlarging his combinatorial semiotics from its bases in the three-trichotomy theory of the 1903 Syllabus over the six-trichotomy theory of 1904–1906 to the sketchlike ten-trichotomy version of 1908, where diagrams rarely figure in the names of sign-types discussed – why?},

  abstract = {Although the visualization of data is on the agenda for sociologists today, thanks to big data, the author raises the question of whether it may not also be possible to visualize theory and, especially, to improve it through visual thinking. The main purpose of this article, more precisely, is to open up a discussion of how visualization and visual thinking can be used as a tool for theorizing in sociology and thereby help produce new and creative theories. Three different types of visualization are discussed: theory pictures, visual sketches, and theorizing diagrams. Theory pictures summarize a theory that has already been developed. Visual sketches are used for early attempts to theorize; they are then typically discarded and replaced by new sketches. Theorizing diagrams draw on ideas from Charles Sanders Peirce and can be described as visual representations that are used to generate new theories. Examples are supplied.},

The general idea is that logic is not different from the other sciences, and its principles are as revisable as scientific principles. This paper has three sections. In section 1, I discuss the meaning of anti-exceptionalism and its place in contemporary logic. In section 2, I analyze some recent developments on this topic by Williamson (2017) and Hjortland (2017), which will motivate my view. In section 3, I propose a puzzle-solving perspective on logical practice. According to my view, there is a common methodology, in which scientists may use non-classical in order to solve some specific puzzles, but classical logic stays in a privileged position, as a common language and as a general theory of reasoning. This role cannot be fulfilled by other logics, and therefore the comparison between classical and non-classical logic is not like a regular comparison between competing hypotheses in science. The methodology of logical practice is therefore not abductive, at least in many important cases. Classical logic is not the “best available theory”, but the fundamental piece of our scientific methodology. My position is still anti-exceptionalist: logic is like any other science, or at least like any other science which can be characterized by a puzzle-solving methodology.},

Authors such as Priest, Hjortland and Williamson have argued that logic can be characterized by an abductive methodology. We choose the logical theory that behaves better under a set of epistemic criteria (such as fit to data, simplicity, fruitfulness, or consistency). In this paper, I analyze some important discussions in the philosophy of logic (intuitionism versus classical logic, semantic paradoxes, and the meaning of conditionals), and I show that they presuppose different methodologies, involving different notions of evidence and different epistemic values. I argue that, rather than having a specific methodology such as abductivism, logic can be characterized by methodological pluralism.

  abstract = {Robert B. Talisse \& Scott F. Aikin Why Pragmatists Cannot be Pluraliste Contemporary pragmatists often maintain that their doctrine is intrinsically allied with pluralism.1 This claim has become so common that it has taken on the lively hue of self-evidence. We contend that pragmatism and pluralism are in fact not compatible, that pragmatists cannot be pluraliste. Our demonstration of this thesis will proceed in an ordinary way: We shall first identify three distinct types of pluralism.2 We shall then identity two general styles of pragmatism.3 Then we shall demonstrate that although certain varieties of pluralism are logically consistent with pragmatism, no pluralism is compatible with pragmatism; that is, we will argue that in cases where pragmatism and pluralism are consistent there are good pragmatic reasons to reject pluralism. Thus the lively hue of selfevidence that once attended the thought that the two are deeply connected should turn to a sickly pall of implausibility. Our mission is not simply negative or polemical. We do not seek merely to refute a self-conception popular among pragmatists. Rather, we aim to further the positive agenda of encouraging pragmatists to make more explicit the nature of their commitments in a way that better enables them to engage critically and fruitfully in a broader set of philosophical conversations concerning pluralism. As we shall indicate in the closing section of this essay, we see this kind of crosstraditional engagement as essential to the health of any philosophical tradition, and absolutely essential in the case of the American pragmatist tradition, which has always upheld the importance of critical exchange. In this way, we see the following essay as a positive contribution to pragmatist philosophy and a decisive step forward in advancing American philosophy. Pluralism: Three Distinct Types Although pluralism comes in many forms, every variety of pluralism begins with a purportedly undeniable fact of moral experience,4 namely, the persistence of disagreement even among well-intentioned and sincere persons at the level of what Bruce Ackerman has fittingly called "Big Questions" (1989, p. 361).5 According to the pluralist, experience teaches that the moral universe contains a rich fund of values, not all of which can be synthesized into a single system. Transactions of the Charles S. Peirce Society Winter, 2005, Vol. XLI, No. 1 102 Robert B. Talisse \& Scott F. Aikin Among goods, many appear incompatible, incompossible, and incommensurable with other goods. Choice among competing but incommensurable goods is inevitable, and such choices form, as Isaiah Berlin claimed in an almost existentialist mode, "an inescapable characteristic of the human condition" (1969, p. 169). However, as the goods among which we must choose are incommensurable, there is no decision procedure that we can appeal to and no summum bonum by means of which the competing options can be ranked. Thus it is no surprise that we find among persons deep differences at the most fundamental moral, religious, and philosophical levels. Moreover, because it is unclear how these differences can be rationally adjudicated, the expectation that we might soon reach widespread moral consensus seems misplaced.6 At the most fundamental level, then, all pluralisms are committed to the claim that the persistence of deep moral disagreement is not due entirely to human frailty, ignorance, stupidity, or wickedness. Stated positively, all pluralisms agree that there are some value conflicts in which every party to the dispute holds a position that fully accords with the best possible reasons and evidence. Hence moral conflict persists because of some facts about the ontology or epistemology of values, not because of some failing of human reason, intellect, or psychology. According to the pluralist, such disagreement is, as Rawls has claimed, a "permanent condition" of human life (1996, p. 129).7 This is the sine qua non of pluralism. Pluraliste divide on the issues of how best to explain this feature of the human moral predicament, and how to respond to it. We identify below the three prescriptive programs that form the basis of our taxonomy of pluralism, but let us first sketch two general explanatory strategies adopted by pluraliste. Some pluraliste offer an epistemic account of the persistence of moral dispute. The exemplar of this approach is John Rawls.8 Appealing to...},

We can give such an account in terms of basic contrarieties, and by co-inductively defining proofs and disproofs, without having to make explicit appeal to the absurdity constant ┴. If we do make such an appeal, it is to ┴ only as a structural punctuation marker within deductions, a device that allows us to assimilate disproofs to the general class of proofs. ┴ does not, in this rôle, need to be governed by any ‘introduction’ or ‘elimination’ rules of its own. Nor does ┴ need to be treated as a propositional constant eligible for embedding within other sentences. But even if we do treat ┴ as an embeddable propositional constant, it does not follow that negation can, let alone should, be defined in terms of it. Negation should be taken as primitive, and one should explain how a grasp of its sense arises from one’s prior grasp of primitive metaphysical contrarieties within an interpreted language.},

The question of whether the proposed meaning theories can be claimed to suffer from circularity is taken up. The relations of the two frameworks to verificationist and anti-realist ideas are considered. Finally, van Heijenoort’s concept of ‘logic as calculus’ generalized by Hintikka to the idea of ‘language as calculus’ will be reformulated as a view we label ‘anti-universalism.’ We discuss briefly the fourfold division of foundational views obtained by relating a distinction between ‘universalism’ and ‘anti-universalism’ to the distinction between ‘realism’ and ‘anti-realism.’},

  abstract = {Depictive expressions of thought predate written language by thousands of years. They have evolved in communities through a kind of informal user testing that has refined them. Analyzing common visual communications reveals consistencies that illuminate how people think as well as guide design; the process can be brought into the laboratory and accelerated. Like language, visual communications abstract and schematize; unlike language, they use properties of the page (e.g., proximity and place: center, horizontal/up–down, vertical/left–right) and the marks on it (e.g., dots, lines, arrows, boxes, blobs, likenesses, symbols) to convey meanings. The visual expressions of these meanings (e.g., individual, category, order, relation, correspondence, continuum, hierarchy) have analogs in language, gesture, and especially in the patterns that are created when people design the world around them, arranging things into piles and rows and hierarchies and arrays, spatial-abstraction-action interconnections termed spractions. The designed world is a diagram.},

  abstract = {In this article I examine the role of anxiety in our motivation to reassess our epistemic states, by taking as a starting point a proposal put forward by Levy (Philosophers' Imprint 16:1–10, 2016), according to which anxiety is responsible for the ruminations and worries about threatening possibilities that we sometimes get caught up into in our everyday life. Levy’s claim is that these irrational persistent thoughts about possible states of affairs are best explained by anxiety, rather than by beliefs, degrees of belief, or other mental states. I will take Levy’s article as a starting point into my study of the role of anxiety in our inclinations to question the epistemic quality of our cognitive states. While I believe that Levy is right in directing our attention to the role of anxiety in these cases, his claim calls for further explanation into the nature of anxiety, and into the mechanisms through which anxiety generates these doubts. Although the relation between anxiety and doubt has already been highlighted (Hookway in: Can J Philos 28:203–225, 1998, Epistemology and emotions, Ashgate Publishing, Hampshire, 2008), there has been little effort to elaborate on the mechanisms through which an affective state like anxiety generates a motivation to reassess our beliefs. This paper is an attempt at providing such an elaboration. Clarifying the role of anxiety in these phenomena will lead me to revise a common assumption about the interactions between anxiety and higher-level cognitive processes, such as the ones involved in representing hypothetical threatening scenarios through mental imagery.},

  abstract = {This is the classic work upon which modern-day game theory is based. What began more than sixty years ago as a modest proposal that a mathematician and an economist write a short paper together blossomed, in 1944, when Princeton University Press published \emph{Theory of Games and Economic Behavior} . In it, John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern conceived a groundbreaking mathematical theory of economic and social organization, based on a theory of games of strategy. Not only would this revolutionize economics, but the entirely new field of scientific inquiry it yielded--game theory--has since been widely used to analyze a host of real-world phenomena from arms races to optimal policy choices of presidential candidates, from vaccination policy to major league baseball salary negotiations. And it is today established throughout both the social sciences and a wide range of other sciences.  This sixtieth anniversary edition includes not only the original text but also an introduction by Harold Kuhn, an afterword by Ariel Rubinstein, and reviews and articles on the book that appeared at the time of its original publication in the \emph{New York Times} , tthe \emph{American Economic Review} , and a variety of other publications. Together, these writings provide readers a matchless opportunity to more fully appreciate a work whose influence will yet resound for generations to come.},

The proposal is substantiated by (i) considerations on assertion, denial, and bi-lateralism, (ii) remarks on compositionality in proof-theoretic semantics, and (iii) comments on falsification and co-implication. The main formal result of the paper is a normal form theorem for the natural deduction proof system N2Int of the bi-intuitionistic logic 2Int. The proof makes use of the faithful embedding of 2Int into intuitionistic logic with respect to validity and shows that conversions of dual proofs can be sidestepped.},

I argue that empirical indefeasibility is essential to the primary notion of the a priori; however, the indefeasibility requirement should be interpreted in such a way that we can be fallibilist about apriori-justified claims. This fallibilist notion of the a priori accords with the naturalist’s commitment to scientific methodology in that it allows for apriori-justified claims to be sensitive to further conceptual developments and the expansion of evidence. The fallibilist apriorist allows that an a priori claim is revisable in only a purely epistemic sense. This modal claim is weaker than what is required for a revisability thesis to establish empiricism, so fallibilist apriorism represents a distinct position.},

It advocates an abductive methodology for choosing, or adjudicating, logics (or, more specifically, logical theories), and notes that the semantic paradoxes constitute promising grounds for an abductive critique of classical logic. As the chapter notes, there is a strong prima facie abductive case for classical logic. This is not due to a principle of conservativism. It does not appeal to the benefits of familiarity with classical logic or the costs of changing the logic. It concerns, rather, intrinsic features of classical logic, such as its simplicity and strength. The chapter concludes that classical logic is doing fine by ordinary criteria and has no need for further justification, so we should keep it.},

  abstract = {I discuss Greg Restall’s attempt to generate an account of logical consequence from the incoherence of certain packages of assertions and denials. I take up his justification of the cut rule and argue that, in order to avoid counterexamples to cut, he needs, at least, to introduce a notion of logical form. I then suggest a few problems that will arise for his account if a notion of logical form is assumed. I close by sketching what I take to be the most natural minimal way of distinguishing content and form and suggest further problems arising for this route.},

Specifically, we propose categories with families of a new variant of games and strategies for both extensional and intensional variants of the type theory with dependent function, dependent pair, and identity types as well as universes. Our games and strategies generalize the existing notion of games and strategies and achieve an interpretation of dependent types and the hierarchy of universes in an intuitive manner. We believe that it is a significant step towards a computational and intensional interpretation of the type theory.},

In particular, we study how the pragmaticist maxim (i.e., the pragmatic maxim fully modalized, support of Peirce's architectonics) can be technically represented in Peirce's existential graphs, well-suited to reveal an underlying continuity in logical operations, and can provide suggestive philosophical analogies. Further, using the existential graphs, we formalize — and prove one direction of — a “local proof of pragmaticism,” trying thus to explain the prominent place that existential graphs can play in the architectonics of pragmaticism, as Peirce persistently advocated. Finally, we present a web of “continuous iterations” of some key Peircean concepts (maxim, classification, abduction) that supports a “lattice of partial proofs” of pragmaticism.},

  abstract = {The concept of truth arguably plays a central role in many areas of philosophical theorizing. Yet, what seems to be one of the most fundamental principles governing that concept, i.e. the equivalence between ‘ ‘P’ is true’ and ‘P’, is inconsistent in full classical logic, as shown by the semantic paradoxes. I propose a new solution to those paradoxes, based on a principled revision of classical logic. Technically, the key idea consists in the rejection of the unrestricted validity of the structural principle of contraction. I first motivate philosophically this idea with the metaphysical picture of the states-of-affairs expressed by paradoxical sentences as being distinctively “unstable”. I then proceed to demonstrate that the theory of truth resulting from this metaphysical picture is, in many philosophically interesting respects, surprisingly stronger than most other theories of truth endorsing the equivalence between ‘ ‘P’ is true’ and ‘P’ (for example, the theory vindicates the validity of the traditional laws of excluded middle and of non-contradiction, and also vindicates the traditional constraint of truth preservation on logical consequence). I conclude by proving a cutelimination theorem that shows the consistency of the theory.},

Logics are characterized, in the most general sense, as sets with consequence relations and translations between logics as consequence-relation preserving maps. In a previous paper the authors introduced the concept of conservative translation between logics and studied some general properties of the co-complete category constituted by logics and conservative translations between them. In this paper we present some conservative translations involving classical logic, Lukasiewicz three-valued system L3, the intuitionistic system I1 and several paraconsistent logics, as for instance Sette's system P1, the D'Ottaviano and da Costa system J3 and da Costa's systems Cn, 1{$\leq$} n{$\leq\omega$}.},

	abstract = {We explore the technical details and historical evolution of Charles Peirce's articulation of a truth table in 1893, against the background of his investigation into the truth-functional analysis of propositions involving implication. In 1997, John Shosky discovered, on the verso of a page of the typed transcript of Bertrand Russell's 1912 lecture on "The Philosophy of Logical Atomism" truth table matrices. The matrix for negation is Russell's, alongside of which is the matrix for material implication in the hand of Ludwig Wittgenstein. It is shown that an unpublished manuscript identified as composed by Peirce in 1893 includes a truth table matrix that is equivalent to the matrix for material implication discovered by John Shosky. An unpublished manuscript by Peirce identified as having been composed in 1883-84 in connection with the composition of Peirce's "On the Algebra of Logic: A Contribution to the Philosophy of Notation" that appeared in the American Journal of Mathematics in 1885 includes an example of an indirect truth table for the conditional.},

To go a step further, this paper explores the notion of dialogue from the perspective of the Theory of Inquiry, which is the core of Peirce’s philosophy. It shows that dialogical features are pervasive in Peircean semiotics and logic. Dialogue in semiotics does not solely refer to a communicative way of sign generation and sign interpretation in its narrowest sense, but it can be systematized as the interpretive routes of Peircean interpretation and communication. To put Peircean dialogue in his semiotics, dialogue is justified as the foundation, situation and method for reaching a final interpretant, seeking the truth and fixing a belief.},

Linear logic contains a fully involutive negationwhile maintaining a strong constructive interpretation.

Para esto, primero se realiza una reconstrucción del problema de la adopción entendido como una reductio, mostrando que el problema se encuentra en el modo en que los agentes aceptan el conocimiento proposicional. Luego de haber diagnosticado el problema muestro que al rebajar el peso de la adopción es necesario introducir las consecuencias prácticas efectivas beneficiosas del principio lógico para que el agente pueda adoptar el principio lógico.
